(We do not currently use the template or page concepts as described in Brad Frost's seminal article introducing atomic design ). Our components are composed (on the front-end) of HTML, Less, and JavaScript. If a component doesn\u2019t have user interactions or require styling, then it won\u2019t have an associated JS and/or Less file. Components that are available for adding to a Wagtail page also require some Python programming\u2014see the creating and editing components page for details. We compose our atomic components as follows: Atoms \u00b6 The smallest kind of component. May not contain any other components. Prefixed with a- in class names.

This file serves as the base HTML template for serving Wagtail pages. Wagtail page Media class \u00b6 Each atomic component has a Media class that lists the JavaScript files that should be loaded via base.html . When a page is requested via the browser, code contained in base.html will loop all atomic components for the requested page and load the appropriate atomic JavaScript bundles.

Pull requests that are not to main must use GitHub labels in such a way that individuals who are responsible for reviewing those pull requests can easily find them. Pull requests that are works-in-progress must be clearly labeled as such. Generally, teams working on cf.gov projects should create and collaborate on feature branches, with frequent merges back to main. Teams are responsible for governing their own branches and forks, these guidelines apply to main.","title":"Branching and merging"},{"location":"browser-acceptance-tests/","text":"Browser/Acceptance Tests \u00b6 Browser testing \u00b6 Our current browser tests (also called acceptance tests) are organized into suites under the test/browser_tests/cucumber-new/features directory.

Reload the settings with source .env . Run the tests with gulp test:acceptance --sauce . Monitor progress of the tests on the Sauce Labs dashboard Automated Tests tab. Note If you get the error Error: ENOTFOUND getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND while running a test, it likely means that Sauce Connect is not running. Writing browser tests \u00b6 Any new tests should be added to an existing suite (e.g. \"default\"), or placed into a new suite directory, in test/browser_tests/cucumber-new/features/suites . All tests start with writing a .feature spec in one of these suites, and then adding corresponding step definitions, found in test/browser_tests/cucumber-new/step_definitions . Do not add new tests to the old test/browser_tests/cucumber directory. Those are all of our legacy tests and are in the process of being removed. Cucumber + Gherkin: tools for running automated tests written in plain language \u00b6 Below are some suggested standards for Cucumber Feature files: Table copied from https://saucelabs.com/blog/write-great-cucumber-tests by Greg Sypolt, with moderate modifications Feature Files Every *.feature file consists in a single feature, focused on the business value. Gherkin Feature:Title (one line describing the story) Narrative Description: As a [role], I want [feature], so that I [benefit] Scenario: Title (acceptance criteria of user story) Given [context] And [some more context]... When [event] Then [outcome] And [another outcome]... Scenario:... Given, When, and Then Statements There might be some confusion surrounding where to put the verification step in the Given, When, Then sequence. Each statement has a purpose. Given is the pre-condition to put the system into a known state before the user starts interacting with the application When describes the key action the user performs Then is observing the expected outcome Just remember the \u2018then\u2019 step is an acceptance criteria of the story. Background The background needs to be used wisely. If you use the same steps at the beginning of all scenarios of a feature, put them into the feature\u2019s background scenario. The background steps are run before each scenario. Background: Given I am logged into Wagtail as an admin And I create a Wagtail Sublanding Page And I open the content menu Scenarios Keep each scenario independent. The scenarios should run independently, without any dependencies on other scenarios. Scenarios should be between 3 to 6 statements, if possible. Scenario Outline If you identify the need to use a scenario outline, take a step back and ask the following question: Is it necessary to repeat this scenario \u2018x\u2019 amount of times just to exercise the different combination of data? In most cases, one time is enough for UI level testing. Declarative Vs Imperative Scenarios The declarative style describes behavior at a higher level, which improves the readability of the feature by abstracting out the implementation details of the application. The imperative style is more verbose but better describes the expected behavior. Either style is acceptable. Example: Declarative Scenario:User logs in Given I am on the homepage When I log in Then I should see a login notification Example: Imperative Scenario: User logs in Given I am on the homepage When I click on the \"Login\" button And I fill in the \"Email\" field with \" me@example.com \" And I fill in the \"Password\" field with \"secret\" And I click on \"Submit\" Then I should see \"Welcome to the app, John Doe\" Further reading \u00b6 Cucumber features Protractor Select elements on a page Writing Jasmin expectations .

Our default TTL is 24 hours. Checking the cache state of a URL \u00b6 To get the current cache state of a URL (perhaps to see if that URL has been invalidated), you can use the following curl command to check the X-Cache header: curl -sI -H \"Pragma: akamai-x-cache-on\" https://beta.consumerfinance.gov | grep \"X-Cache\" It will return something like: X-Cache: TCP_HIT from a23-46-239-53.deploy.akamaitechnologies.com (AkamaiGHost/9.5.4-24580776) (-) The possible cache state values are: TCP_HIT : The object was fresh in cache and object from disk cache. TCP_MISS : The object was not in cache, server fetched object from origin. TCP_REFRESH_HIT : The object was stale in cache and we successfully refreshed with the origin on an If-modified-Since request. TCP_REFRESH_MISS : Object was stale in cache and refresh obtained a new object from origin in response to our IF-Modified-Since request. TCP_REFRESH_FAIL_HIT : Object was stale in cache and we failed on refresh (couldn't reach origin) so we served the stale object. TCP_IMS_HIT : IF-Modified-Since request from client and object was fresh in cache and served. TCP_NEGATIVE_HIT : Object previously returned a \"not found\" (or any other negatively cacheable response) and that cached response was a hit for this new request.

TCP_COOKIE_DENY : Denied access on cookie authentication (if centralized or decentralized authorization feature is being used in config). Django caching \u00b6 Starting in December 2017, we use template fragment caching to cache all or part of a template. It is enabled on our \"post previews\", snippets of a page that we display on results of filterable pages (e.g. our blog page & research & reports ). It can easily be enabled on other templates. See this PR as an example of the code that would need to be introduced to cache a new fragment. When a page gets published, it will update the post preview cache for that particular page. However, if there are code changes that impact the page's content, or the post preview template itself gets updated, the entire post preview cache will need to be manually cleared. Clearing this particular cache could be an option when deploying, as it is with Akamai, but should not be a default since most deploys wouldn't impact the code in question. Currently, the manual way to do this would be to run the following from a production server's django shell: from django.core.cache import caches caches['post_preview'].clear() To run the application locally with caching for post previews enabled, run ENABLE_POST_PREVIEW_CACHE=1 ./runserver.sh Alternatively, add this variable to your .env if you generally want it enabled locally. Due to the impossibility/difficulty/complexity of caching individual Wagtail blocks (they are not serializable) and invalidating content that does not have some type of post_save hook (e.g. Taggit models), we have started with caching segments that are tied to a Wagtail page (which can be easily invalidated using the page_published Wagtail signal), hence the post previews.

The CFPB Design System describes the design and intended usage of many of these components. In Wagtail parlance, these are called \"StreamField blocks\" * (or just \"blocks\"). We sometimes also refer to them as \"modules\", because we think that the terms \"component\" and \"module\" may be more obvious to non-developers. This page will use the terms somewhat interchangeably. One other important thing to note before we begin: blocks can be nested within other blocks. * If you're going to be doing anything more than making minor updates to existing components, this is highly recommended reading.

The back end \u00b6 The Python class \u00b6 A component's fields and other properties are defined in a Python class, typically a subclass of Wagtail's StructBlock . These classes are located in a number of different files across the repository, but there are two major categories they fall into: Files corresponding to a general-purpose, site-wide atomic component. These files\u2014 atoms.py , molecules.py , and organisms.py \u2014are located in cfgov/v1/atomic_elements . Files that are specific to a particular sub-app, such as regulations3k's blocks.py . There are other places where StreamField block classes are defined (particularly blocks that are only ever used as fields within another block), but these are the two most common locations where top-level Wagtail modules are stored. A simple component class looks like this: class RelatedContent(blocks.StructBlock): # 1 heading = blocks.CharBlock(required=False) # 2 paragraph = blocks.RichTextBlock(required=False) # 3 links = blocks.ListBlock(atoms.Hyperlink()) # 4 class Meta: # 5 icon = 'grip' # 6 label = 'Related content' # 7 template = '_includes/molecules/related-content.html' # 8 There are a few things happening here: The RelatedContent class is a subclass of Wagtail's StructBlock , which allows for the combination of a fixed number of other sub-blocks (see previous comment about blocks being nested within other blocks) into a single unit (what we'd think of as a \"module\" in the Wagtail editor). This one has three sub-blocks (lines 2, 3, and 4). The heading field uses the basic Wagtail CharBlock , which results in a field with a basic single-line text input. The paragraph field uses the basic Wagtail RichTextBlock , which results in a field with a multiline WYSIWYG text input. The links field uses another basic Wagtail block, ListBlock , which is a special type of block that can hold a variable number of some other block (the Hyperlink atom block, in this case). The Meta class defines some properties on the RelatedContent block that are used by the Wagtail admin or in rendering the block. The icon property tells Wagtail what icon to use in the editor for the button you use to add a RelatedContent block to a StreamField. Icon options can be found in the Wagtail style guide when running locally: http://localhost:8000/admin/styleguide/#icons The optional label property overrides the text of that same button; if label is not set, Wagtail will generate one from the name of the block. The template property is a pointer to the HTML template used to render this component. See below for more on templates. This results in a module that looks like this in the Wagtail editor: Note again that what we think of as fields are also blocks, and what we think of as components or modules are a special kind of block, StructBlock , that comprise the sub-blocks that are our fields. There are two common optional things that are also used in component classes: Overriding the default get_context method to pass additional data to the template Adding component-specific JavaScript via the Media class Adding it to a StreamField \u00b6 Components are made available in the page editing interface by adding them to one of a page types's StreamFields. These are usually the first things in a page's class definition. For example, see this snippet from blog_page.py : class BlogPage(AbstractFilterPage): content = StreamField([ ('full_width_text', organisms.FullWidthText()), ('info_unit_group', organisms.InfoUnitGroup()), ('expandable', organisms.Expandable()), ('well', organisms.Well()), ('email_signup', organisms.EmailSignUp()), ('feedback', v1_blocks.Feedback()), ]) \u2026 This sets up a StreamField named content that allows for the insertion of any of those seven listed blocks into it. To make the RelatedContent module (shown above) available to this StreamField, we'd add a new entry to this list following the same format: ('related_content', molecules.RelatedContent()), . Most page types have two StreamFields ( header and content ) in the general content area (the first tab on an editing screen), and most also share a common sidefoot StreamField (so named for the fact that it appears on the right side on some page types, but in the footer on others) on the sidebar tab. Don't forget the migrations! Adding or changing fields on either Python class will always require a new Django schema migration ; additionally, changing field names or types on an existing block will require a Django data migration . See the guide on creating migrations for StreamField blocks for more details. The front end \u00b6 Before diving into the front-end code, a reminder to visit the Notes on Atomic Design page to learn about how we conceive of components in a hierarchy of atoms, molecules, and organisms. The HTML template \u00b6 Frontend rendering of Wagtail StreamField blocks to HTML can be controlled by writing a Django template and associating it with the block type. A custom block definition can specify the template path in its Meta class: from wagtail.core import blocks class PersonBlock(blocks.StructBlock): name = blocks.CharBlock() email = blocks.EmailBlock() class Meta: template = 'myapp/blocks/person_block.html' StreamField block templates are loaded by the Django template loader in the same way that Django page templates are. The specified template path must be loadable by one of the Django template engines configured in settings.TEMPLATES . (This project supports both the standard Django templates backend and the Jinja2 backend , but Jinja2 is more commonly used.) See the Django templates documentation for more details on the search algorithm used to locate a template. Returning to the RelatedContent example, this is what its Jinja2 template looks like (comments excluded): <div class=\"m-related-content\"> {% if value.heading %} <header class=\"m-slug-header\"> <h2 class=\"a-heading\"> {{ value.heading }} </h2> </header> {% endif %} {{ value.paragraph | safe }} {% if value.links %} <ul class=\"m-list m-list__links\"> {% for link in value.links %} <li class=\"m-list_item\"> <a href=\"{{ link.url }}\" class=\"m-list_link\">{{ link.text }}</a> </li> {% endfor %} </ul> {% endif %} </div> When Wagtail renders a block, it includes the values of its fields in an object named value . Above, you can see where the heading and paragraph fields are output with Jinja2 expression tags . And note how the links field (a ListBlock ) is iterated over, and the values of its Hyperlink child blocks are output. That's about as simple an example as it gets, but block templates can get much more complex when they have lots of child blocks and grandchild blocks. Also, if a block definition has overridden get_context to pass other data into the template (as described at the end of the Python class section above), those context variables can also be output with simple Jinja2 expression tags: {{ context_var }} . Adding CSS \u00b6 If a component needs any custom styling not already provided by the Design System or consumerfinance.gov, you can add it by creating a new Less file for the component. Note Please be sure that you actually need new Less before creating it. We have a wide array of styles already available in the Design System components and here in consumerfinance.gov , some of which could perhaps be combined to achieve your desired result. Also be sure that new component designs have gone through our internal approval process before adding them to the project. If you're working on a general-purpose atomic component for site-wide use, this file should live in cfgov/unprocessed/css/<atoms|molecules|organisms>/ . (Choose the deepest folder according to the atomic rank of the component.) Continuing the RelatedContent example, if it needed its own styles, it would live at cfgov/unprocessed/css/molecules/related-content.less . Newly-created Less files need to be imported into the project's main main.less file, located at cfgov/unprocessed/css/main.less . Please place them in the appropriate section for their atomic rank. Because consumerfinance.gov uses main.less to build a single CSS file for almost the entire project, it is not necessary to tell the Python model anything about a component-specific stylesheet (for general-purpose, site-wide components). That is not the case with JavaScript, as we will see in the next section. Note If you're working on a component that belongs to a particular sub-app, its Less file should live in cfgov/unprocessed/<app-name>/css/ . Adding JavaScript \u00b6 Each atomic component may optionally be given a Media class that can list one or more JavaScript files that should be loaded when using it. When a page is requested via the browser, code contained in base.html will loop all atomic components for the requested page and load the appropriate atomic JavaScript bundles. Here is how one would add the Media class to our RelatedContent example: class RelatedContent(blocks.StructBlock): \u2026 # see first example on this page class Media: js = ['related-content.js'] (The related-content.js file would need to be placed in cfgov/unprocessed/js/molecules/ ; see Notes on Atomic Design .) This will load the related-content.js script on any page that includes the RelatedContent molecule in one of its StreamFields. How-to guides \u00b6 Creating a new component \u00b6 Review the Notes on Atomic Design page. Add each of the parts mentioned above: Create the Python class Add the class to a StreamField Create an HTML template for the component (Optionally) add some CSS (Optionally) add some JavaScript Note Before creating a new component, please consider whether one of our existing components can meet your needs. Talk to the consumerfinance.gov product owners if your content has specific display requirements that aren't served by an existing component, or if a specific maintenance efficiency will be gained from a new component. Adding a field to an existing component \u00b6 Locate the Python class of the component you want to add a field to. Add the field by inserting a snippet like this in the list of fields, in the order in which you want it to appear in the editor: field_name = blocks.BlockName() . Replace field_name with a succinct name for what data the field contains Replace BlockName with one of the basic Wagtail block types . Sometimes we create our own custom blocks that can be used, as well. See, for example, the HeadingBlock , used in InfoUnitGroup , among other places. Add any desired parameters: required=False if you do not want the field to be required (it usually is, by default) label='Some label' if you would like the editor to show a label more meaningful than the sentence-case transformation of the field name help_text='Some text' if the field needs a more verbose explanation to be shown in the editor to make it clear to users how it should work default=<some appropriate value> if you want the field to have a specific default value, e.g., True to have a BooleanBlock checkbox default to checked. Certain blocks may take other arguments, as described in the basic Wagtail blocks documentation . Edit the component template to do something with the field's data \u2013 output it, use it to trigger a CSS class, etc. Create a schema migration. Editing a field on an existing component \u00b6 Determine if the change you want to make will need a data migration. If the answer is no : make your changes, create a schema migration , and be on your merry way. If the answer is yes : continue on. Add the new version of the field. Create a schema migration for adding the new field. Create a data migration to copy data from the old field into the new field. Edit the component template to use the new field's data instead of the old field's data. Remove the old field. Create a schema migration for removing the old field.

Delete the field definition. Create a schema migration. Creating migrations for StreamField blocks \u00b6 To automatically generate a schema migration , run ./cfgov/manage.py makemigrations -n <description_of_changes> from the root of the repository. You may also need a data migration \u00b6 Some field edits (like changing the default , label , help_text , and required properties, or changing the order of fields on a block) do not require a data migration. A schema migration is sufficient. Data migrations are required any time you: rename an existing field change the type of an existing field delete an existing field rename a block within a StreamField delete a block if you do not want to lose any data already stored in that field or block. In other words, if an existing field or block is changing, any data stored in that field or block has to be migrated to a different place, unless you're OK with jettisoning it. Not sure if there's actually any data that could potentially be lost? \u00b6 You may not know off the top of your head if a component you are modifying actually has any data stored that could be lost. One way that you can manually check to see if this is the case is to use the Block Inventory feature that we added to Wagtail . This feature lets you search all Wagtail pages on the site for the presence of a component. Here's how: With a current database dump, visit http://localhost:8000/admin/inventory/ . (This is also available from the admin menu by going to Settings > Block Inventory .) Using the three pairs of dropdown menus at the top of the page, choose to look for pages that either include or exclude particular components. If multiple components are selected, resulting pages must match all of the conditions. Click Find matching pages to execute the search. If no results are found, lucky you! You're in the clear to make whatever changes you desire to that component without worrying about data loss. If, more likely, there are results, you should open each result, look through the page for the instance(s) of the component in question, and see if the changes you want to make would cause the loss of important data. If there is only a small amount of potential data loss, it may be more practical to forego the data migration and manually replace that data once the code changes have been deployed. If you think this is the preferable route, consult with the appropriate stakeholders to confirm that they are OK with the window of time in which users may experience a gap in the data that is being manually replaced.

These classes are located in a number of different files across the repository, but there are two major categories they fall into: Files corresponding to a general-purpose, site-wide atomic component. These files\u2014 atoms.py , molecules.py , and organisms.py \u2014are located in cfgov/v1/atomic_elements . Files that are specific to a particular sub-app, such as regulations3k's blocks.py . There are other places where StreamField block classes are defined (particularly blocks that are only ever used as fields within another block), but these are the two most common locations where top-level Wagtail modules are stored. A simple component class looks like this: class RelatedContent(blocks.StructBlock): # 1 heading = blocks.CharBlock(required=False) # 2 paragraph = blocks.RichTextBlock(required=False) # 3 links = blocks.ListBlock(atoms.Hyperlink()) # 4 class Meta: # 5 icon = 'grip' # 6 label = 'Related content' # 7 template = '_includes/molecules/related-content.html' # 8 There are a few things happening here: The RelatedContent class is a subclass of Wagtail's StructBlock , which allows for the combination of a fixed number of other sub-blocks (see previous comment about blocks being nested within other blocks) into a single unit (what we'd think of as a \"module\" in the Wagtail editor). This one has three sub-blocks (lines 2, 3, and 4). The heading field uses the basic Wagtail CharBlock , which results in a field with a basic single-line text input. The paragraph field uses the basic Wagtail RichTextBlock , which results in a field with a multiline WYSIWYG text input. The links field uses another basic Wagtail block, ListBlock , which is a special type of block that can hold a variable number of some other block (the Hyperlink atom block, in this case). The Meta class defines some properties on the RelatedContent block that are used by the Wagtail admin or in rendering the block. The icon property tells Wagtail what icon to use in the editor for the button you use to add a RelatedContent block to a StreamField. Icon options can be found in the Wagtail style guide when running locally: http://localhost:8000/admin/styleguide/#icons The optional label property overrides the text of that same button; if label is not set, Wagtail will generate one from the name of the block. The template property is a pointer to the HTML template used to render this component. See below for more on templates. This results in a module that looks like this in the Wagtail editor: Note again that what we think of as fields are also blocks, and what we think of as components or modules are a special kind of block, StructBlock , that comprise the sub-blocks that are our fields. There are two common optional things that are also used in component classes: Overriding the default get_context method to pass additional data to the template Adding component-specific JavaScript via the Media class","title":"The Python class"},{"location":"editing-components/#adding-it-to-a-streamfield","text":"Components are made available in the page editing interface by adding them to one of a page types's StreamFields.

To make the RelatedContent module (shown above) available to this StreamField, we'd add a new entry to this list following the same format: ('related_content', molecules.RelatedContent()), . Most page types have two StreamFields ( header and content ) in the general content area (the first tab on an editing screen), and most also share a common sidefoot StreamField (so named for the fact that it appears on the right side on some page types, but in the footer on others) on the sidebar tab. Don't forget the migrations! Adding or changing fields on either Python class will always require a new Django schema migration ; additionally, changing field names or types on an existing block will require a Django data migration .

A custom block definition can specify the template path in its Meta class: from wagtail.core import blocks class PersonBlock(blocks.StructBlock): name = blocks.CharBlock() email = blocks.EmailBlock() class Meta: template = 'myapp/blocks/person_block.html' StreamField block templates are loaded by the Django template loader in the same way that Django page templates are. The specified template path must be loadable by one of the Django template engines configured in settings.TEMPLATES . (This project supports both the standard Django templates backend and the Jinja2 backend , but Jinja2 is more commonly used.) See the Django templates documentation for more details on the search algorithm used to locate a template. Returning to the RelatedContent example, this is what its Jinja2 template looks like (comments excluded): <div class=\"m-related-content\"> {% if value.heading %} <header class=\"m-slug-header\"> <h2 class=\"a-heading\"> {{ value.heading }} </h2> </header> {% endif %} {{ value.paragraph | safe }} {% if value.links %} <ul class=\"m-list m-list__links\"> {% for link in value.links %} <li class=\"m-list_item\"> <a href=\"{{ link.url }}\" class=\"m-list_link\">{{ link.text }}</a> </li> {% endfor %} </ul> {% endif %} </div> When Wagtail renders a block, it includes the values of its fields in an object named value . Above, you can see where the heading and paragraph fields are output with Jinja2 expression tags . And note how the links field (a ListBlock ) is iterated over, and the values of its Hyperlink child blocks are output. That's about as simple an example as it gets, but block templates can get much more complex when they have lots of child blocks and grandchild blocks. Also, if a block definition has overridden get_context to pass other data into the template (as described at the end of the Python class section above), those context variables can also be output with simple Jinja2 expression tags: {{ context_var }} .","title":"The HTML template"},{"location":"editing-components/#adding-css","text":"If a component needs any custom styling not already provided by the Design System or consumerfinance.gov, you can add it by creating a new Less file for the component.

The Django-Flags documentation contains an overview of feature flags and how to use them and the Wagtail-Flags README describes how to add feature flag conditions in the Wagtail admin. This document covers how to add and use feature flags with consumerfinance.gov and the conventions we have around their use. Adding a flag Checking a flag In templates Jinja2 Django In code In URLs Enabling a flag Hard-coded conditions Database conditions Satellite apps Hygiene Adding a flag \u00b6 Feature flags are defined in code in the cfgov/settings/base.py file as part of the FLAGS setting. Each flag consists of a single string and a Python list of its hard-coded conditions (see Enabling a flag below). FLAGS = { # Beta banner, seen on beta.consumerfinance.gov # When enabled, a banner appears across the top of the site proclaiming # \"This beta site is a work in progress.\" 'BETA_NOTICE': [], } By convention our flag names are all uppercase, with underscores instead of whitespace. A comment is expected above each flag with a short description fo what happens when it is enabled. Checking a flag \u00b6 Flags can be checked either in Python code or in Django or Jinja2 template files. See the full Wagtail Flags API is documented for more information. In templates \u00b6 Jinja2 \u00b6 Most of consumerfinance.gov's templates are Jinja2. In these templates, two template functions are provided, flag_enabled and flag_disabled . Each takes a flag name as its first argument and request` object as the second. flag_enabled('MY_FLAG') will return True if the conditions under which MY_FLAG is enabled are met. flag_disabled('MY_FLAG') will return True if the conditions under which MY_FLAG is enabled are not met. See Enabling a flag below for more on flag conditions. An example is the BETA_NOTICE flag as implemented in header.html : {% if flag_enabled('BETA_NOTICE') and show_banner %} <div class=\"m-global-banner\"> <div class=\"wrapper wrapper__match-content o-expandable o-expandable__expanded\"> <div class=\"m-global-banner_head\"> <span class=\"cf-icon cf-icon-error-round m-global-banner_icon\"></span> This beta site is a work in progress. </div> \u2026 </div> </div> {% endif %} Django \u00b6 In Django templates (used in Satellite apps and the Wagtail admin), two template functions are provided flag_enabled and flag_disabled once the feature_flags template tag library is loaded. flag_enabled 'MY_FLAG' will return True if the conditions under which MY_FLAG is enabled are met. flag_disabled 'MY_FLAG' will return True if the conditions under which MY_FLAG is enabled are not met. See Enabling a flag below for more on flag conditions. The BETA_NOTICE Jinja2 example above when implemented with Django templates would look like this: {% load feature_flags %} {% flag_enabled 'BETA_NOTICE' as beta_flag %} {% if beta_flag and show_banner %} <div class=\"m-global-banner\"> <div class=\"wrapper wrapper__match-content o-expandable o-expandable__expanded\"> <div class=\"m-global-banner_head\"> <span class=\"cf-icon cf-icon-error-round m-global-banner_icon\"></span> This beta site is a work in progress. </div> \u2026 </div> </div> {% endif %} In code \u00b6 In Python code three functions are available for checking feature flags, flag_state , flag_enabled , and flag_disabled . The Python API is slightly different from the Jinja2 or Django template API, in that flag conditions can take more potential arguments than requests, and thus flags are more flexible when checked in Python (in and outside a request cycle). See the Django-Flags flag state API documentation for more . Additionally two decorators, flag_check and flag_required , are provided for wrapping views (and another functions) in a feature flag check. See the Django-Flags flag decorators API documentation for more . In URLs \u00b6 There are two ways to flag Django URL patterns in urls.py : with flagged_url() in place of url() for a single pattern, or with the flagged_urls() context manager for multiple URLs. flagged_url(flag_name, regex, view, kwargs=None, name=None, state=True, fallback=None) works exactly like url() except it takes a flag name as its first argument. If the flag's state matches the given state , the URL pattern will be served from the given view ; if not, and fallback is given, the fallback will be used. An example is our WAGTAIL_ABOUT_US flag : flagged_url('WAGTAIL_ABOUT_US', r'^about-us/$', lambda req: ServeView.as_view()(req, req.path), fallback=SheerTemplateView.as_view( template_name='about-us/index.html'), name='about-us'), Ignoring the view being a lambda for now (see Flagging Wagtail URLs below ), this URL will be served via Wagtail if WAGTAIL_ABOUT_US 's conditions are True , and from a TemplateView if its conditions are False . If you need to flag multiple URLs with the same flag, you can use the flagged_urls() context manager. with flagged_urls(flag_name, state=True, fallback=None) as url provides a context in which the returned url() function can be used in place of the Django url() function in patterns and those patterns will share the same feature flag, state, and fallback. An example is our WAGTAIL_ASK_CFPB flag : with flagged_urls('WAGTAIL_ASK_CFPB') as url: ask_patterns = [ url(r'^(?i)ask-cfpb/([-\\w]{1,244})-(en)-(\\d{1,6})/?$', view_answer, name='ask-english-answer'), url(r'^(?i)obtener-respuestas/([-\\w]{1,244})-(es)-(\\d{1,6})/?$', view_answer, name='ask-spanish-answer'), \u2026 ] urlpatterns += ask_patterns Warning Do not attempt to use flag_check or any flag state-checking functions in urls.py . Because they will be evaluated on import of urls.py they will attempt to access the Django FlagState model before it is ready and will error. Flagging Wagtail URLs \u00b6 Wagtail views in flagged_url with a Django view as fallback (or vice-versa) can be a bit awkward. Django views are typically called with request as the first argument, and Wagtail's serve view takes both the request and the path. To get around this, in flagged_url we typically use a lambda for the view: lambda req: ServeView.as_view()(req, req.path) This lambda takes the request and calls the Wagtail-Sharing ServeView (which we're using in place of wagtail.core.views.serve ). Enabling a flag \u00b6 Feature flags are enabled based on a set of conditions that are given either in the Django settings files (in cfgov/cfgov/settings/ ) or in the Django or Wagtail admin. Multiple conditions can be given, both in settings and in the admin, and if any condition is satisfied a flag is enabled. A list of available conditions and how to use them is available in the Django-Flags documentation . Hard-coded conditions \u00b6 Conditions that are defined in the Django settings are hard-coded, and require a change to files in consumerfinance.gov, a new tagged release, and new deployment to change. These conditions should be used for flags that are relatively long-lasting and that can require a round-trip through the release and deployment process to change. When adding a flag to the Django settings the flag's dictionary of conditions can contain a condition name and value that must be satisfied for the flag to be enabled. The nature of that value changes depending on the condition type. See the Django-Flags conditions documentation for more on individual conditions. There is a simple boolean condition that is either True or False , and if it is True the flag is enabled and if it is False the flag is disabled. If we want to always turn the BETA_NOTICE flag on in settings with a boolean condition, that would look like this: FLAGS = { # Beta banner, seen on beta.consumerfinance.gov # When enabled, a banner appears across the top of the site proclaiming # \"This beta site is a work in progress.\" 'BETA_NOTICE': [ { 'condition': 'boolean', 'value': True, }, ], } Database conditions \u00b6 Conditions that are managed via the Wagtail or Django admin are stored in the database. These conditions can be changed in real-time and do not require any code changes or release and deployment to change (presuming the code that uses the feature flag is in place). To view, delete, and add database conditions, navigate to \"Settings > Flags\" in the Wagtail admin. Once in the flag settings, you'll have a list of all flags and their statuses. Select a flag to see its conditions. Existing database conditions can be edited or deleted here. To create a new database condition, select \"Add a condition\". As with hard-coded conditions , to create a database condition you must select which condition type you would like to use and give it a value that must be satisfied for the flag to be enabled. Database conditions can only be set for flags that exist in the Django settings. Satellite apps \u00b6 Feature flags can be used in satellite apps in exactly the same way they are used in consumerfinance.gov. An example is the use of a feature flagged template choice in the complaintdatabase app . Hygiene \u00b6 Feature flags should be rare and ephemeral. Changes should be small and frequent, and not big-bang releases, and flags that are no longer used and their conditions should be cleaned up and removed from code and the database.","title":"Feature Flags"},{"location":"feature-flags/#feature-flags","text":"Feature flags are implemented using our Django-Flags and Wagtail-Flags apps.

If the flag's state matches the given state , the URL pattern will be served from the given view ; if not, and fallback is given, the fallback will be used. An example is our WAGTAIL_ABOUT_US flag : flagged_url('WAGTAIL_ABOUT_US', r'^about-us/$', lambda req: ServeView.as_view()(req, req.path), fallback=SheerTemplateView.as_view( template_name='about-us/index.html'), name='about-us'), Ignoring the view being a lambda for now (see Flagging Wagtail URLs below ), this URL will be served via Wagtail if WAGTAIL_ABOUT_US 's conditions are True , and from a TemplateView if its conditions are False . If you need to flag multiple URLs with the same flag, you can use the flagged_urls() context manager. with flagged_urls(flag_name, state=True, fallback=None) as url provides a context in which the returned url() function can be used in place of the Django url() function in patterns and those patterns will share the same feature flag, state, and fallback. An example is our WAGTAIL_ASK_CFPB flag : with flagged_urls('WAGTAIL_ASK_CFPB') as url: ask_patterns = [ url(r'^(?i)ask-cfpb/([-\\w]{1,244})-(en)-(\\d{1,6})/?$', view_answer, name='ask-english-answer'), url(r'^(?i)obtener-respuestas/([-\\w]{1,244})-(es)-(\\d{1,6})/?$', view_answer, name='ask-spanish-answer'), \u2026 ] urlpatterns += ask_patterns Warning Do not attempt to use flag_check or any flag state-checking functions in urls.py .

Users enter a U.S. ZIP code, and the tool returns a list of the ten housing counselors nearest to that ZIP code location. The page also displays a map of the results using Mapbox. When the user enters a ZIP code in the page's search box, the Django view fetches a JSON file of the results from our Amazon S3 bucket. The results are inserted into the page template and the Mapbox map . The page also contains a link to a PDF version of the results, which is also stored in S3. The files are publicly accessible, so the tool can run on localhost or in a container without any change in behavior. This page documents the process we use to generate the JSON and PDF files the Find a Housing Counselor tool relies on. Housing Counselor Data Processing \u00b6 The tool gets its data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD provides an API to their list of approved counseling agencies. A daily job, cf.gov-housing-counselor-data on our external Jenkins server, queries HUD data and produces the JSON and PDF files we use for the Find a Housing Counselor tool. It performs the following steps, each of which is optional and configured using parameters before starting the job. Geocode ZIP codes ( GEOCODE_ZIPCODES ) Generate JSON files ( MAKE_JSON ) Generate HTML files ( MAKE_HTML ) Generate PDFs ( MAKE_PDF ) Upload to S3 ( UPLOAD_TO_S3 ) Geocode ZIP codes \u00b6 The GEOCODE_ZIPCODES step generates a file of all ZIP codes in the United States and their location latitude and longitude and saves it in the Jenkins workspace. By default, this step is not enabled. Since ZIP code geographical information rarely changes, we run this step rarely by manually enabling the option in the Jenkins job. If enabled, this step calls the hud_geocode_zipcodes management command. The management command in turn calls the BulkZipCodeGeocoder in geocoder.py . BulkZipCodeGeocoder uses the Mapbox geocoding API to determine which 5-digit number sequences are ZIP codes and fetch their latitude and longitude values. The management command inserts this data into a CSV and saves it to ./zipcodes.csv on the Jenkins job workspace. The generated file looks like this: 12305,42.81,-73.94 12306,42.77,-73.96 12307,42.81,-73.93 12308,42.82,-73.93 12309,42.81,-73.91 12325,42.88779,-73.99597 12345,42.80856,-74.02737 Generate JSON files \u00b6 When enabled, the MAKE_JSON step generates a JSON file of housing counselor data for each ZIP code in the U.S. Each file contains the ten results geographically nearest to the ZIP code's latitude and longitude. This step is enabled by default. This step calls the hud_generate_json management command, which performs the following steps: fetch agency listings from HUD save a copy of the full results, for our records clean the results fill in any missing latitude and longitude values create files of the 10 nearest results for each U.S. ZIP code Fetch agency listings \u00b6 ( in fetcher.py ) Request every housing counselor in HUD's database with a request to https://data.hud.gov/Housing_Counselor/searchByLocation?Lat=38.8951&Long=-77.0367&Distance=5000 . It returns thousands of results like this: { \"services\": \"DFC,FBC,PPC,RHC\", \"languages\": \"ENG,SPA\", \"agc_STATUS\": \"A\", \"agc_SRC_CD\": \"HUD\", \"counslg_METHOD\": \"Face to Face Counseling,Group Counseling,Phone Counseling\", \"agcid\": \"80790\", \"adr1\": \"1234 N.

We replace the services value with fully spelled out service descriptions. Both of these mappings come from the HUD API. Save the results \u00b6 ( in results_archiver.py ) Save a copy of the full set of results as a zip file in the home directory. The Jenkins job then transfers the zip file to S3 as part of the MAKE JSON step. The file is saved in S3 at /archive/{date}.zip . This copy can be used as the canonical set of HUD data that day in case of an enforcement action. Clean the results \u00b6 ( in cleaner.py ) Clean the data: Convert latitude and longitude values to float values. Convert the the city and organization name to title case. Ensure email appears to be an email (otherwise leave it blank). If a URL value is present, ensure it begins with http:// . Backfill missing latitude and longitude values \u00b6 ( in geocoder.py ) If any counselor records are missing their latitude or longitude data, we fill in those values with the lat/long location of the agency's ZIP code. This uses the data file created in the Geocode ZIP Codes stage of the Jenkins job ( above ). Create collections of results by ZIP code \u00b6 ( in generator.py ) Create an in-memory SQLite database and define a distance_in_miles function in it. Fill the database with a three-column table: For each counselor in the list, include its latitude and longitude (both in radians) and all of its information from the HUD API as a JSON text string. For each ZIP code in the U.S., query the database to find the 10 closest housing counselors to the lat/long of that ZIP. Put the information in a JSON structure like this (but with ten results instead of one): { \"zip\": { \"lat\": 42.80856, \"lng\": -74.02737, \"zipcode\": \"12345\" }, \"counseling_agencies\": [{ \"adr1\": \"1234 N.

Generate HTML files \u00b6 When enabled, the MAKE_HTML step generates an HTML page of housing counselor results, including styles, for each file created in the previous step. It saves them in an htmls directory on the Jenkins job workspace. This step is enabled by default. This step calls the hud_generate_html management command, which calls HTML generation code in generator.py . Django renders the housing_counselor/pdf_selfcontained.html template with the housing counselor data from each JSON file. We save the resulting HTML files on the Jenkins job workspace, in a htmls directory, e.g. htmls/12345.html . Generate PDFs \u00b6 When enabled, the MAKE_PDF step generates a PDF of each file created in the previous step. It saves them in a pdfs directory on the Jenkins job workspace.

We run the conversion on each file in the htmls directory, generating a PDF version of each, e.g. pdfs/12345.pdf .

This is advised if you are going to be doing development on consumerfinance.gov and contributing to the project. There are two ways to install consumerfinance.gov: Stand-alone installation Docker-based installation Stand-alone installation \u00b6 These instructions are somewhat specific to developing on macOS, but if you're familiar with other Unix-based systems, it should be fairly easy to adapt them to your needs. Install system-level requirements \u00b6 virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper Python modules \u00b6 Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to be able to create a local environment for your server: pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper Autoenv module \u00b6 This project uses a large number of environment variables. To automatically define environment variables and launch the virtualenv upon cd ing to the project folder, install Autoenv . We recommend using Homebrew : brew install autoenv After installation, Homebrew will output instructions similar to: To finish the installation, source activate.sh in your shell: source /Users/[YOUR USERNAME]/homebrew/opt/autoenv/activate.sh Run that now for your initial setup. Any time you run the project you\u2019ll need to run that last line, so if you\u2019ll be working with the project consistently, we suggest adding it to your Bash profile by running: echo 'source /Users/[YOUR USERNAME]/homebrew/opt/autoenv/activate.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile If you need to find this info again later, you can run: brew info autoenv Note If you use Zsh you\u2019ll need to use zsh-autoenv , but we can\u2019t provide support for issues that may arise. Front-end dependencies \u00b6 The consumerfinance.gov front-end build process currently includes the following frameworks / tools: Gulp : task management for pulling in assets, linting and concatenating code, etc. Less : CSS pre-processor. Design System : User interface pattern-library produced by the CFPB. Node.js . Install however you\u2019d like. We recommend using nvm , though. If your node version is outdated you should receive a console error to upgrade while attempting to build the project. Yarn . We recommend installing using Homebrew : # Use --ignore-dependencies to use your system installed node version brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies Webfonts \u00b6 The site uses a proprietary licensed font, Avenir. If you want to pull this from a content delivery network (CDN), you can set the @use-font-cdn to true and rebuild the assets with yarn run gulp build . If you want to install self-hosted fonts locally, you can place the font files in static.in/cfgov-fonts/fonts/ and restart the local web server. If you are a CFPB employee, you can perform this step with: cd static.in/ && git clone https://[GHE]/CFGOV/cfgov-fonts/ Where [GHE] is our GitHub Enterprise URL. Set up your environment \u00b6 The Django app relies on environment variables defined in a .env file. If this is your first time setting up the project, copy .env_SAMPLE to .env and then source that file: cp -a .env_SAMPLE .env source .env Each time you start a new session for working on this project, you'll need to get those environment variables and get your virtualenv running again. If you setup Autoenv earlier, this will happen for you automatically when you cd into the project directory. If you prefer not to use Autoenv, just be sure to source .env every time you start a new session of work on the project. Install Postgres \u00b6 If you're on a Mac and use Homebrew, you can easily install Postgres: brew install postgresql Once it's installed, you can configure it to run as a service: brew services start postgresql Then create the database, associated user, and schema for that user: dropdb --if-exists cfgov && dropuser --if-exists cfpb createuser --createdb cfpb && createdb -O cfpb cfgov psql postgres://cfpb@localhost/cfgov -c 'CREATE SCHEMA cfpb' We don't support using an SQLite database, because we use database fields that are specific to Postgres. The --createdb flag above allows Django to create temporary Postgres databases when running unit tests. Run the setup script \u00b6 At this point, your machine should have everything it needs to automate the rest of the setup process. If you haven't cloned this repo yet, clone it to a local folder. Because related projects will need to be installed as siblings to this project, we recommend putting them all in their own folder, e.g., ~/Projects/cf.gov . Once cloned, from the project root ( ~/Projects/cf.gov/consumerfinance.gov/ ), run this command to complete the setup process: ./setup.sh This will take several minutes, going through the steps in these scripts: frontend.sh backend.sh Once complete, you should have a fully functioning local environment, ready for you to develop against! There are some optional setup steps that you may want to perform before continuing. Want to know more about what the setup scripts are doing? Read the detailed rundown. Continue following the usage instructions . Docker-based installation \u00b6 Tools we use for developing with Docker \u00b6 Docker : You may not need to interact directly with Docker, but you should know that it's a client/server application for managing containers (a way of running software in an isolated environment) and images (a snapshot of all of the files necessary to run a container). Docker Compose : Compose allows you to configure and run a collection of connected containers (like a web application and its database). 1. Setup your Docker environment \u00b6 If you have never installed Docker before, follow the instructions here or from your operating system vendor. The default Docker installation on some systems includes Docker Compose. For systems where this is not the case, Docker Compose will need to be installed manually . To verify the installation of Docker Compose, the command docker-compose ps should run without error if Docker is running locally. Copy the .env_SAMPLE file over \u00b6 The Docker Compose setup (see docker-compose.yml ) provides the environment variables defined in .env to the container running the Django app. If this is your first time setting up the project, copy .env_SAMPLE to .env : cp -a .env_SAMPLE .env 2. Setup your frontend environment \u00b6 Refer to the front-end dependencies described above in the standalone installation instructions . 3. Run setup \u00b6 ./setup.sh docker This will install and build the frontend and set up the docker environment. 4. Run Docker Compose for the first time \u00b6 docker-compose up This will download and/or build images, and then start the containers, as described in the docker-compose.yml file. This will take a few minutes, or longer if you are on a slow Internet connection. When it's all done, you should be able to load http://localhost:8000 in your browser, and see a database error. Note Trying to use Docker Compose and finding that it gives you an error? Something like: ERROR: In file ./.env: environment variable name `export DJANGO_HTTP_PORT` may not contain whitespace. You've probably running the latest version of Docker Desktop that's available to us (CFPB developers) in Self Service, which comes with a version of Docker Compose that changes how it handles .env files. Docker Compose has been updated to fix this, but the fix is still in the Release Candidate stage (as of June 1, 2020), it may be some time before that fix gets packaged with a new version of Docker Desktop, and longer still before that version of Docker Desktop gets packaged up and made available to us in Self Service, so we need a workaround. 1. Install pipx, if you haven't yet \u00b6 If you have not yet set up pipx on your computer, follow our guide to installing and using pipx to do so. 2. Install docker-compose with pipx \u00b6 With that all set, we're ready to install the latest Docker Compose. pipx install docker-compose Confirm that it installed properly by running which docker-compose and seeing the pipx path: $ which docker-compose /Users/<username>/.local/bin/docker-compose Finally, we'll need to inject another Python package, python-dotenv, into pipx's isolated docker-compose environment: pipx inject docker-compose python-dotenv 3. Profit! \u00b6 At this point, you should be able to run docker-compose commands again. Note: When running docker-compose up in consumerfinance.gov with our typical .env file, you may see some warnings like the following: WARNING: Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 236 WARNING: Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 239 WARNING: Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 236 WARNING: Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 239 WARNING: Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 236 WARNING: Python-dotenv could not parse statement starting at line 239 These are caused by the if statement that will override some of the variables when sourcing the .env file in a local (non-Docker) environment. They can safely be ignored. 5. Setup the database \u00b6 Open a bash shell inside your Python container. docker-compose exec python bash You can either load initial data per the instructions below, or load a database dump. You could save some time and effort later (if you have access to the CFPB network), by configuring a URL for database dumps in the .env file. CFGOV_PROD_DB_LOCATION=http://(rest of the URL) You can get that URL at [GHE]/CFGOV/platform/wiki/Database-downloads#resources-available-via-s3 The first time you add this value to .env (and any time you make a change to that file) you will either need to run source .env from the container or docker-compose down && docker-compose up from your standard shell to pick up the changes. With CFGOV_PROD_DB_LOCATION in .env you should be able to run: ./refresh-data.sh Otherwise, the instructions to load a database dump below should be enough to get you started. Once you have a database loaded, you should have a functioning copy of site working at http://localhost:8000 6. Next Steps \u00b6 See Running in Docker to continue after that. Optional steps \u00b6 Load initial data into database \u00b6 The initial-data.sh script can be used to initialize a new database to make it easy to get started working on Wagtail. This script first ensures that all migrations are applied to the database, and then does the following: Creates an admin superuser with password admin . If it doesn't already exist, creates a new Wagtail home page named CFGOV , with a slug of cfgov . Updates the default Wagtail site to use the port defined by the DJANGO_HTTP_PORT environment variable, if defined; otherwise this port is set to 80. If it doesn't already exist, creates a new wagtail-sharing SharingSite with a hostname and port defined by the WAGTAIL_SHARING_HOSTNAME and DJANGO_HTTP_PORT environment variables. Load a database dump \u00b6 If you're installing this fresh, the initial data you receive will not be as extensive as you'd probably like it to be. You can get a database dump by: Going to [GHE]/CFGOV/platform/wiki/Database-downloads Selecting one of the extractions and downloading the production_django.sql.gz file Run: ./refresh-data.sh /path/to/dump.sql.gz The refresh-data.sh script will apply the same changes as the initial-data.sh script described above (including setting up the admin superuser), but will not apply migrations. To apply any unapplied migrations to a database created from a dump, run: python cfgov/manage.py migrate Sync local image storage \u00b6 If using a database dump, pages will contain links to images that exist in the database but don't exist on your local disk. This will cause broken or missing images when browsing the site locally. For example, in production images are stored on S3, but when running locally they are stored on disk. This project includes a Django management command that can be used to download any remote images referenced in the database so that they can be served when running locally. cfgov/manage.py sync_image_storage https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/ ./cfgov/f/ This downloads all remote images (and image renditions) referenced in the database, retrieving them from the specified URL and storing them in the specified local directory. Set variables for working with the GovDelivery API \u00b6 Uncomment and set the GovDelivery environment variables in your .env file. Note GovDelivery is a third-party web service that powers our emails. The API is used by subscribe forms on our website. Users may decide to swap this tool out for another third-party service. Install GNU gettext for Django translation support \u00b6 In order to generate Django translations as documented here , you'll need to install the GNU gettext library. On MacOS, GNU gettext is available via Homebrew: brew install gettext but it gets installed as \"keg-only\" due to conflicts with the default installation of BSD gettext. This means that GNU gettext won't be loaded in your PATH by default. To fix this, you can run brew link --force gettext to force its installation, or see brew info gettext for an alternate solution. If installed locally, you should be able to run this command successfully: $ gettext --version GNU gettext is also required to run our translation-related unit tests locally. Curious about what the setup scripts are doing? \u00b6 Here's a rundown of each of the scripts called by setup.sh and what they do. 1. frontend.sh \u00b6 Initialize project dependency directories ( init ) This script first checks for an argument passed from the command line that can trigger different options for different environments. Since you ran it with no arguments, it will set up the dev environment. It then creates a checksum for package-lock.json (if it exists) and package.json . This will be used later to determine if dependencies need to be installed. It will then set some env vars for the Node dependency directories. 1. Clean and install project dependencies ( clean_and_install ) The script will now compare the checksums to see if it needs to install dependencies, or if they are already up-to-date. If the checksums do not match, the script will empty out all installed dependencies ( clean ) so the new installation can start fresh, then install the latest requested dependencies ( install ). The devDependencies from package.json are not installed if the environment is production, and if it's the dev or test environment, it checks to see if Protractor is globally installed. Finally, it creates a new checksum for future comparisons. 1. Run tasks to build the project for distribution ( build ) Finally, the script runs yarn run gulp build to rebuild the front-end assets. It no longer cleans first, because the gulp-changed plugin prevents rebuilding assets that haven't changed since the last build. If this is the production environment, it also triggers style and script builds for ondemand , which aren't part of a standard gulp build . Note If you are having trouble loading JavaScript edits locally, you may need to turn off service workers for localhost:8000. Learn how to manage service workers in Firefox and Chrome . 2. backend.sh \u00b6 Note backend.sh is not used for our Docker setup. Confirm environment ( init ) This script first checks for an argument passed from the command line that can trigger different options for different environments. Since you ran it with no arguments, it will set up the dev environment. It will then run a script to ensure that you're in a virtualenv. If not, the script will end, to prevent you from accidentally installing your Python dependencies globally. Install project dependencies ( install ) Python dependencies are installed into the virtualenv via pip.

All unit tests Tests for individual apps Tests for regular modules Tests for molecules Tests for organisms Test-driven development \u00b6 We recommend using test-driven development (TDD) when coding new JavaScript. The general concept is to start by writing your test first , with the expected behavior and functionality well-described, then you write the code that makes the test pass. A good pithy summary is: Write only enough of a unit test to fail. Write only enough production code to make the failing unit test pass. Then repeat that process until you have written all of the code you need. Read this primer on test-driven development to learn more about how it differs from the typical approach to programming and unit tests. Setting up tests \u00b6 New test file from sample \u00b6 For this guide, we\u2019ll use very basic sample code files to illustrate how to use the test framework in consumerfinance.gov and how to test very common code patterns. Another common approach is to look for existing tests that are testing something similar to what you are writing now. Feel free to do so and copy from an existing module and its tests instead of copying the sample files referenced below. For links to existing tests, refer back to the \u201cWhere to find tests\u201d section . Now, let\u2019s begin! Let\u2019s make a new unit test fail, then we will make it pass, following the principles of TDD. Copy the sample test file to a new location by running this command from the root of consumerfinance.gov: cp docs/samples/sample-spec.js test/unit_tests/js/modules/ Copy the sample module file to a new location by running this command: cp docs/samples/sample.js cfgov/unprocessed/js/modules/ Test file names should always match what they are testing, with the addition of a -spec suffix. Folder structure (where to put your JavaScript and tests) \u00b6 JavaScript unit test files belong in the test/unit_tests/ directory. The folder structure of the test files mirrors the structure of the project JavaScript in cfgov/unprocessed/js/ . When considering exactly where to place JavaScript in these directories, it might be helpful to review the documentation about atomic components in consumerfinance.gov . JavaScript corresponding to atomic elements should go into the appropriate subfolder for the type of element being implemented. In our case, sample.js and sample-spec.js don\u2019t relate to atomic elements, so they can be placed into the uncategorized modules subfolders: cfgov/unprocessed/js/modules and test/unit_tests/modules , respectively. Child apps If you\u2019re working on something in a child app, put it in test/unit_test/appname/js/ . Otherwise, if you\u2019re working on something that belongs to consumerfinance.gov generally, it should go in the corresponding folder under test/unit_test/js/ . First test run \u00b6 Now that you have your sample JS and test files in the right places, let\u2019s try running them and see what happens! I\u2019ll refer to sample-spec.js and sample.js in the instructions below, but you should work in your own new test file and JavaScript file to save and commit your changes. Edit line 6 of your spec file and remove the call to the .skip method. The line should now read: it( 'should return a string with expected value', () => { \u2026 } ); Run your sample test using gulp test:unit --specs=js/modules/sample-spec.js (substituting your own filename). You should see output like this: The test should fail \u2013 this is expected. Remember, when doing TDD, we want to write our test to fail first, then write the corresponding JavaScript that will make the test pass. Make the test pass by changing your script\u2019s line 7 ( see sample.js ) to the following: return 'Shredder'; Run the test again to confirm the test now passes. You should see output like this: Doesn\u2019t it feel good? Refer back to the \u201cRunning unit tests\u201d section for additional commands to run tests. File structure (basic layout of a test file) \u00b6 In order to make the sample-spec.js more meaningful to your own use case, you\u2019ll need to know how to structure a unit test using Jest methods. Let\u2019s take a look at the structure of our very basic sample test file. Loading dependencies \u00b6 Line 1 of any spec file will use an import statement to include the JavaScript file that you are testing. Additional dependencies should be added in the same manner. import sample from '../../../../cfgov/unprocessed/js/modules/sample.js'; Some test files use const declarations to require scripts instead of import , because those files were written before import was available. We prefer to use import because it allows for tree shaking in Webpack , meaning if two modules are importing the same module it should only be included in the bundle once, whereas with require it would be included twice. A consequence is that variables can\u2019t be used in the import path, as they prevent Webpack from figuring out which modules are duplicates. For example, this snippet shows how a require statement should be converted to an import statement, but without including the BASE_JS_PATH variable in the file path: // This works, but could duplicate footer-button.js, if other files also require it. const FooterButton = require( BASE_JS_PATH + 'modules/footer-button.js' ); // This doesn't work and the build will fail. import * as FooterButton from BASE_JS_PATH + 'modules/footer-button.js'; // This is ugly, but it works and supports tree shaking. import * as FooterButton from '../../../../cfgov/unprocessed/js/modules/footer-button.js'; import also provides a benefit in that you can choose specific parts of a module so that you only import the dependencies you need. For testing purposes, we will typically import the whole module to make sure we have full test coverage. Read the import reference guide on MDN on how to implement import for different use cases. The describe function \u00b6 In Jest (whose syntax is based on Jasmine), describe blocks serve as organizational structures that you can use to outline the methods you need in your JS module. The root describe method is where we put the name of the JavaScript module we are testing. For the sample, the name of our module is sample , so we set this up on line 4 of sample-spec.js : describe( 'sample', () => { \u2026 } ); This module name will appear in your test output in the console when the test is running: More complex tests will have additional describe blocks \u2013 children of the root describe block \u2013 that should correspond to a particular method in the module. For example, if we want to add more functionality to our sample JS, we could start by writing these tests in sample-spec.js : describe( 'sample', () => { describe( 'gimmeString()', () => { it( 'should return a string with expected value', () => { const sampleString = 'Shredder'; expect( sample.gimmeString() ).toBe( sampleString ); } ); } ); describe( 'gimmeObject()', () => { it( 'should return an object with expected value', () => { const sampleObject = { image: 'https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tmnt/images/0/00/Krangnobody.png', caption: 'Krang portrait' }; expect( sample.gimmeObject() ).toBe( sampleObject ); } ); } ); } ); (We\u2019ll talk more about writing the individual tests in the next section.) And then we would create the gimmeString and gimmeObject methods in our sample.js file. Another example is breakpoint-state-spec.js , which tests several methods, including getBreakpointState and viewportIsIn , on the module breakpoint-state . When using TDD, you may prefer to add describe blocks later, during the refactor stage of writing code. Individual tests \u00b6 Within a describe block, individual tests are encapsulated by it methods, which is an alias of Jest\u2019s test method . Each test must include one or more assertions (usually only one) that confirm that the result of executing some code is what you expected. These are called \u201cmatchers\u201d in Jest parlance, and they all follow this format: expect( someValue ).someKindOfComparisonWith( someOtherValue ); For example, let\u2019s take another look at the sample tests we wrote above: describe( 'sample', () => { describe( 'gimmeString()', () => { it( 'should return a string with expected value', () => { const sampleString = 'Shredder'; expect( sample.gimmeString() ).toBe( sampleString ); } ); } ); describe( 'gimmeObject()', () => { it( 'should return an object with expected value', () => { const sampleObject = { image: 'https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tmnt/images/0/00/Krangnobody.png', caption: 'Krang portrait' }; expect( sample.gimmeObject() ).toBe( sampleObject ); } ); } ); } ); In these tests, we check ( expect ) that the string returned by sample.gimmeString() and the object returned by sample.gimmeObject() match ( toBe ) the sampleString and sampleObject that we defined in the tests. There are many kinds of assertions you can use besides the simple equality comparison of toBe . See the Jest Using Matchers guide for a primer on them and the Jest expect API docs for the full list of its matchers. Providing test data \u00b6 The first principle of test data for unit tests is to keep test data as simple as possible \u2013 use the minimum needed to test the code. Direct definition of test data \u00b6 The simplest way to set up test data is to declare it as variables within each test, e.g., the tests in strings-spec.js . This can include HTML markup for DOM manipulation tests, if each test requires different markup. Setup and teardown methods \u00b6 If you will need to leverage the same test data across different tests, Jest has setup and teardown methods, such as beforeEach and afterEach , or beforeAll and afterAll , which can be used to performing actions that are needed before and after running all tests or each test in a suite. For example, the tests in Analytics-spec.js use both beforeAll and beforeEach inside the root describe block to do a variable definition for all tests at the beginning of the suite and reset the dataLayer before each test, respectively. Check out the Jest documentation on \u201cSetup and teardown\u201d methods. A common structure when the DOM is involved is to create a constant representing an HTML snippet to test, then \u2013 in a beforeEach or beforeAll (depending on whether the tests modify the markup or not) \u2013 set document.body.innerHTML to that snippet. Use beforeAll to attach HTML markup that is unaffected by the tests, e.g., the tests in footer-button-spec.js . Use beforeEach to reset manipulated markup between tests, e.g., the tests in Notification-spec.js . See \u201cTesting DOM manipulation\u201d in the \u201cCommon test patterns\u201d section of this page for a more in-depth discussion of this scenario. Common test patterns \u00b6 Testing a basic function \u00b6 Testing simple functions is pretty straightforward. Each function in a module should have tests set up as a child describe within the module\u2019s own describe . Then, write a number of it statements in prose that describe how the function should respond to various kinds of input. Inside each it , invoke the function with the input described in the it statement and use expect to check that you receive the desired result. Here is a simple example from our array helpers module ( cfgov/unprocessed/js/modules/util/array-helpers.js ): function indexOfObject( array, key, val ) { let match = -1; if ( !array.length > 0 ) { return match; } array.forEach( function( item, index ) { if ( item[key] === val ) { match = index; } } ); return match; } Tests for that function, from test/unit_tests/js/modules/util/array-helpers-spec.js : describe( 'indexOfObject()', () => { it( 'should return -1 if the array is empty', () => { array = []; index = arrayHelpers.indexOfObject( array, 'foo' ); expect( index ).toBe( -1 ); } ); it( 'should return -1 if there is no match', () => { array = [ { value: 'bar' }, { value: 'baz' } ]; index = arrayHelpers.indexOfObject( array, 'value', 'foo' ); expect( index ).toBe( -1 ); } ); it( 'should return the matched index', () => { array = [ { value: 'foo' }, { value: 'bar' }, { value: 'baz' } ]; index = arrayHelpers.indexOfObject( array, 'value', 'foo' ); expect( index ).toBe( 0 ); } ); } ); Testing DOM manipulation \u00b6 Jest , the JavaScript testing framework we use, includes jsdom , which simulates a DOM environment as if you were in the browser. This means that we can call any DOM API in our test code and observe it in the same way as we do in the module code itself, which acts on the browser\u2019s DOM. As an example, let\u2019s look at our Notification component. The Notification component uses a common set of markup with different classes and SVG icon code to style it as a particular kind of notification (success, warning, etc.). In the component JS , we have this function that sets the type of a notification before displaying it: function _setType( type ) { // If type hasn't changed, return. if ( _currentType === type ) { return this; } // Remove existing type class const classList = _dom.classList; classList.remove( `${ BASE_CLASS }__${ _currentType }` ); if ( type === SUCCESS || type === WARNING || type === ERROR ) { // Add new type class and update the value of _currentType classList.add( `${ BASE_CLASS }__${ type }` ); _currentType = type; // Replace <svg> element with contents of type_ICON const currentIcon = _dom.querySelector( '.cf-icon-svg' ); const newIconSetup = document.createElement( 'div' ); newIconSetup.innerHTML = ICON[type]; const newIcon = newIconSetup.firstChild; _dom.replaceChild( newIcon, currentIcon ); } else { throw new Error( `${ type } is not a supported notification type!` ); } return this; } This function would be invoked by an instance of the Notification class. _dom is the DOM node for the Notification. As you can see from the code comments above, it has a few different steps that modify the DOM node. Now let\u2019s look at the tests. Here are the first 22 lines of the spec file that tests this component: import Notification from '../../../../cfgov/unprocessed/js/molecules/Notification'; const BASE_CLASS = 'm-notification'; const HTML_SNIPPET = ` <div class=\"m-notification\"> <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 1200\" class=\"cf-icon-svg\"></svg> <div class=\"m-notification_content\"> <div class=\"h4 m-notification_message\">Notification content</div> </div> </div> `; describe( 'Notification', () => { let notificationElem; let notification; let thisNotification; beforeEach( () => { document.body.innerHTML = HTML_SNIPPET; notificationElem = document.querySelector( `.${ BASE_CLASS }` ); notification = new Notification( notificationElem, BASE_CLASS, {} ); } ); \u2026 } ); The main things to note here at the beginning of the file are the addition of the HTML_SNIPPET definition, containing the markup we will used for testing as it would be rendered for this component, and the beforeEach function that (1) uses jsdom to add that snippet to the test environment and assigns the component node to the notificationElem variable, and (2) creates a new instance of the Notification class. A word about HTML_SNIPPET s Right now it\u2019s possible to update a component\u2019s Jinja template, forget to update the corresponding JavaScript, and the unit tests would still pass, because they're using their own HTML_SNIPPET . It would be preferable if we had a canonical component markup template that is pulled in by the application, the unit tests, and the docs. We haven\u2019t yet figured out how to do this, since our component templates contain Jinja tags that the tests would have to reconcile into a complete, finished chunk of markup. For now, just be aware of this when editing a Wagtail component that includes JavaScript . Further down, here are some of the tests that cover the _setType function (by way of the setTypeAndContent function that wraps both _setType and _setContent ): describe( 'setTypeAndContent()', () => { it( 'should update the notification type for the success state', () => { notification.init(); notification.setTypeAndContent( notification.SUCCESS, '' ); expect( notificationElem.classList ).toContain( 'm-notification__success' ); } ); it( 'should update the notification type for the warning state', () => { notification.init(); notification.setTypeAndContent( notification.WARNING, '' ); expect( notificationElem.classList ).toContain( 'm-notification__warning' ); } ); \u2026 } ); This part mostly works like testing any other function. The notable distinction here is that the test invokes the function using the DOM nodes and class set up in beforeEach . Testing browser state \u00b6 Another common thing to test is code that interacts with the state of the browser itself, e.g., fragment identifiers, query strings, or other things in the URL; the window object; session storage; page history; etc. One way of doing this is to create a spy (a special kind of mocked function) that watches for browser API calls to be made a certain number of times or with a specific payload. One example is found in the tests for our full-table-row-linking code . In the module code ( o-table-row-links.js ), if an event listener detects a click anywhere on one of these special table rows, it invokes window.location to send the browser to the href of the first link in that row: window.location.assign( target.querySelector( 'a' ).getAttribute( 'href' ) ); To test this, in the aforementioned o-table-row-links-spec.js file, we first set up a standard Jest mock for window.location.assign , and then create our spy to watch it: describe( 'o-table-row-links', () => { beforeEach( () => { window.location.assign = jest.fn(); locationSpy = jest.spyOn( window.location, 'assign' ); \u2026 } ); \u2026 } ); A little further down (after finishing the DOM setup and initializing the module we\u2019re testing), we have three tests that simulate clicks and then assert things that the spy can answer for us: whether it was called with a particular location parameter, and that it was called a specific number of times (zero). it( 'should navigate to new location when link row cell clicked', () => { simulateEvent( 'click', linkRowCellDom ); expect( locationSpy ).toBeCalledWith( 'https://www.example.com' ); } ); it( 'should not set window location when link is clicked', () => { simulateEvent( 'click', linkDom ); expect( locationSpy ).toHaveBeenCalledTimes( 0 ); } ); it( 'should not navigate to new location when non link row cell clicked', () => { simulateEvent( 'click', nonLinkRowCellDom ); expect( locationSpy ).toHaveBeenCalledTimes( 0 ); } ); Testing user interaction \u00b6 Testing user interaction with simulated pointer events, keystrokes, or form submissions is best handled via browser tests, not unit tests. User interaction in a unit test could falsely pass if the component wasn\u2019t visible on the page, for instance.

We prefer to use import because it allows for tree shaking in Webpack , meaning if two modules are importing the same module it should only be included in the bundle once, whereas with require it would be included twice. A consequence is that variables can\u2019t be used in the import path, as they prevent Webpack from figuring out which modules are duplicates. For example, this snippet shows how a require statement should be converted to an import statement, but without including the BASE_JS_PATH variable in the file path: // This works, but could duplicate footer-button.js, if other files also require it. const FooterButton = require( BASE_JS_PATH + 'modules/footer-button.js' ); // This doesn't work and the build will fail. import * as FooterButton from BASE_JS_PATH + 'modules/footer-button.js'; // This is ugly, but it works and supports tree shaking. import * as FooterButton from '../../../../cfgov/unprocessed/js/modules/footer-button.js'; import also provides a benefit in that you can choose specific parts of a module so that you only import the dependencies you need.

This means that we can call any DOM API in our test code and observe it in the same way as we do in the module code itself, which acts on the browser\u2019s DOM. As an example, let\u2019s look at our Notification component. The Notification component uses a common set of markup with different classes and SVG icon code to style it as a particular kind of notification (success, warning, etc.). In the component JS , we have this function that sets the type of a notification before displaying it: function _setType( type ) { // If type hasn't changed, return. if ( _currentType === type ) { return this; } // Remove existing type class const classList = _dom.classList; classList.remove( `${ BASE_CLASS }__${ _currentType }` ); if ( type === SUCCESS || type === WARNING || type === ERROR ) { // Add new type class and update the value of _currentType classList.add( `${ BASE_CLASS }__${ type }` ); _currentType = type; // Replace <svg> element with contents of type_ICON const currentIcon = _dom.querySelector( '.cf-icon-svg' ); const newIconSetup = document.createElement( 'div' ); newIconSetup.innerHTML = ICON[type]; const newIcon = newIconSetup.firstChild; _dom.replaceChild( newIcon, currentIcon ); } else { throw new Error( `${ type } is not a supported notification type!` ); } return this; } This function would be invoked by an instance of the Notification class. _dom is the DOM node for the Notification. As you can see from the code comments above, it has a few different steps that modify the DOM node. Now let\u2019s look at the tests. Here are the first 22 lines of the spec file that tests this component: import Notification from '../../../../cfgov/unprocessed/js/molecules/Notification'; const BASE_CLASS = 'm-notification'; const HTML_SNIPPET = ` <div class=\"m-notification\"> <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 1200\" class=\"cf-icon-svg\"></svg> <div class=\"m-notification_content\"> <div class=\"h4 m-notification_message\">Notification content</div> </div> </div> `; describe( 'Notification', () => { let notificationElem; let notification; let thisNotification; beforeEach( () => { document.body.innerHTML = HTML_SNIPPET; notificationElem = document.querySelector( `.${ BASE_CLASS }` ); notification = new Notification( notificationElem, BASE_CLASS, {} ); } ); \u2026 } ); The main things to note here at the beginning of the file are the addition of the HTML_SNIPPET definition, containing the markup we will used for testing as it would be rendered for this component, and the beforeEach function that (1) uses jsdom to add that snippet to the test environment and assigns the component node to the notificationElem variable, and (2) creates a new instance of the Notification class. A word about HTML_SNIPPET s Right now it\u2019s possible to update a component\u2019s Jinja template, forget to update the corresponding JavaScript, and the unit tests would still pass, because they're using their own HTML_SNIPPET . It would be preferable if we had a canonical component markup template that is pulled in by the application, the unit tests, and the docs. We haven\u2019t yet figured out how to do this, since our component templates contain Jinja tags that the tests would have to reconcile into a complete, finished chunk of markup. For now, just be aware of this when editing a Wagtail component that includes JavaScript . Further down, here are some of the tests that cover the _setType function (by way of the setTypeAndContent function that wraps both _setType and _setContent ): describe( 'setTypeAndContent()', () => { it( 'should update the notification type for the success state', () => { notification.init(); notification.setTypeAndContent( notification.SUCCESS, '' ); expect( notificationElem.classList ).toContain( 'm-notification__success' ); } ); it( 'should update the notification type for the warning state', () => { notification.init(); notification.setTypeAndContent( notification.WARNING, '' ); expect( notificationElem.classList ).toContain( 'm-notification__warning' ); } ); \u2026 } ); This part mostly works like testing any other function. The notable distinction here is that the test invokes the function using the DOM nodes and class set up in beforeEach .","title":"Testing DOM manipulation"},{"location":"javascript-unit-tests/#testing-browser-state","text":"Another common thing to test is code that interacts with the state of the browser itself, e.g., fragment identifiers, query strings, or other things in the URL; the window object; session storage; page history; etc. One way of doing this is to create a spy (a special kind of mocked function) that watches for browser API calls to be made a certain number of times or with a specific payload. One example is found in the tests for our full-table-row-linking code . In the module code ( o-table-row-links.js ), if an event listener detects a click anywhere on one of these special table rows, it invokes window.location to send the browser to the href of the first link in that row: window.location.assign( target.querySelector( 'a' ).getAttribute( 'href' ) ); To test this, in the aforementioned o-table-row-links-spec.js file, we first set up a standard Jest mock for window.location.assign , and then create our spy to watch it: describe( 'o-table-row-links', () => { beforeEach( () => { window.location.assign = jest.fn(); locationSpy = jest.spyOn( window.location, 'assign' ); \u2026 } ); \u2026 } ); A little further down (after finishing the DOM setup and initializing the module we\u2019re testing), we have three tests that simulate clicks and then assert things that the spy can answer for us: whether it was called with a particular location parameter, and that it was called a specific number of times (zero). it( 'should navigate to new location when link row cell clicked', () => { simulateEvent( 'click', linkRowCellDom ); expect( locationSpy ).toBeCalledWith( 'https://www.example.com' ); } ); it( 'should not set window location when link is clicked', () => { simulateEvent( 'click', linkDom ); expect( locationSpy ).toHaveBeenCalledTimes( 0 ); } ); it( 'should not navigate to new location when non link row cell clicked', () => { simulateEvent( 'click', nonLinkRowCellDom ); expect( locationSpy ).toHaveBeenCalledTimes( 0 ); } );","title":"Testing browser state"},{"location":"javascript-unit-tests/#testing-user-interaction","text":"Testing user interaction with simulated pointer events, keystrokes, or form submissions is best handled via browser tests, not unit tests.

Table of contents \u00b6 Reference material Do I need to create a migration?

Even experienced Django developers may find it unintuitive to determine which changes will require a migration. Example model changes that require a migration: Adding, removing, or renaming a model field Changing a model field definition in a way that impacts the database schema (for example, changing the size of a CharField ) Changing a model field definition in a way that does not impact the database schema (for example, changing the field's help_text ) Example model changes that do not require a migration: Adding, removing, renaming, or modifying a model class method Modifying a model class manager The best way to tell if your changes require a migration is to ask Django to determine that for you. Django's makemigrations management command can be used for this purpose: ./cfgov/manage.py makemigrations --dry-run If you haven't made any changes to your local source code that would necessitate the creation of a new migration, this command will print No changes detected . Otherwise, if you have made changes that require a migration, Django will print information about the migration that would need to be created: Migrations for 'v1': cfgov/v1/migrations/0154_auto_20190412_1008.py - Alter field alt on cfgovimage Running with the --dry-run flag won't actually create any migration files on disk. See below for more information on how to do this, including how to give your migrations a more descriptive name. Schema migrations \u00b6 Any time you add or change a field on a Django model, Wagtail page model (which are a particular kind of Django model), or StreamField block class, a Django schema migration will be required. This includes changes as small as modifying the help_text string. To automatically generate a schema migration, run the following, editing it to give your migration a name that briefly describes the change(s) you're making: ./cfgov/manage.py makemigrations -n <description_of_changes> For examples of good migration names, look through some of our existing migration files . Note Some changes will generate multiple migration files. If you change a block that is used in pages defined in different sub-apps, you will see a migration file for each of those sub-apps. Migration numbering and conflicts \u00b6 When a migration file is generated, it will automatically be given a unique four-digit number at the beginning of its filename. These numbers are assigned in sequence, and they end up being a regular source of conflicts between pull requests that are in flight at the same time. If a PR with a migration gets merged between the time you create your migration and the time that your PR is ready for merging, you will have to update your branch as normal to be current with main and then re-create your migration. Also note that our back-end tests that run in GitHub Actions will fail if a required schema migration is missing or if migrations are in conflict with one another. Data migrations \u00b6 Data migrations are required any time you: rename an existing field change the type of an existing field delete an existing field rename a block within a StreamField delete a block if you do not want to lose any data already stored in that field or block. In other words, if an existing field or block is changing, any data stored in that field or block has to be migrated to a different place, unless you're OK with jettisoning it. There is no automatic generation mechanism like there is for schema migrations. You must write the script by hand that automates the transfer of data from old fields to new fields. To generate an empty migration file for your data migration, run: ./cfgov/manage.py makemigrations --empty yourappname You can also copy the code below to get started with forward() and backward() functions to migrate your model's data: from django.db import migrations def forwards(apps, schema_editor): MyModel = apps.get_model('yourappname', 'MyModel') for obj in MyModel.objects.all(): # Make forward changes to the object pass def backwards(apps, schema_editor): MyModel = apps.get_model('yourappname', 'MyModel') for obj in MyModel.objects.all(): # Make backward changes to the object pass class Migration(migrations.Migration): dependencies = [] operations = [ migrations.RunPython(forwards, backwards), ] The forwards() and backwards() functions are where any changes that need to happen to a model's data are made. Note While backwards migrations are necessary in external libraries that we create, we do not require them in consumerfinance.gov because we prefer not to rollback migrations that have already been applied. Wagtail-specific considerations \u00b6 Django data migrations with Wagtail can be challenging because programmatic editing of Wagtail pages is difficult , and pages have both revisions and StreamFields. This section describes ways we try to address these challenges in consumerfinance.gov. The data migration needs to modify both the existing Wagtail pages that correspond to the changed model and all revisions of that page. It also needs to be able to manipulate the contents of StreamFields. As described in the editing a component guide , it's a three-step process to modify a field without losing data: Create the new field with an automatic schema migration Use a handwritten data migration script to move data from the old field to the new field Delete the old field with an automatic schema migration We've written some utility functions in consumerfinance.gov that make writing data migrations for StreamFields easier. Using these utilities, a Django data migration that modifies a StreamField would use the following format: from django.db import migrations from v1.util.migrations import migrate_page_types_and_fields def forward_mapper(page_or_revision, data): # Manipulate the stream block data forwards return data def backward_mapper(page_or_revision, data): # Manipulate the stream block data backwards return data def forwards(apps, schema_editor): page_types_and_fields = [ ('myapp', 'MyPage', 'field_name', 'block_name'), ] migrate_page_types_and_fields( apps, page_types_and_fields, forward_mapper ) def backwards(apps, schema_editor): page_types_and_fields = [ ('myapp', 'MyPage', 'field_name', 'block_name'), ] migrate_page_types_and_fields( apps, page_types_and_fields, backward_mapper ) class Migration(migrations.Migration): dependencies = [] operations = [ migrations.RunPython(forwards, backwards), ] field_name is the name of the StreamField on the Page model that contains the blocks to migrate. block_name is the name of the block within a StreamField that contains the data to be migrated. StreamBlocks can themselves also contain child blocks. The block name can be given as a list of block names that form the \"path\" to the block that needs to be migrated. For example : def forwards(apps, schema_editor): page_types_and_fields = [ ('myapp', 'MyPage', 'field_name', ['parent_block', 'child_block']), ] migrate_page_types_and_fields( apps, page_types_and_fields, forward_mapper ) In this example, a block with the name child_block that is inside a block named parent_block will be passed to the forward_mapper function. The data that gets passed to the forward_mapper or backward_mapper is a JSON-compatible Python dict that corresponds to the block's schema. Utility functions \u00b6 These functions, defined in v1.util.migrations , are used in the above data migration example. They reduce the amount of boilerplate required to work with Wagtail StreamField data in data migrations. migrate_page_types_and_fields(apps, page_types_and_fields, mapper) \u00b6 Migrate the fields of a Wagtail page type using the given mapper function. page_types_and_fields should be a list of 4-tuples providing ('app', 'PageType', 'field_name', 'block_name') or ('app', 'PageType', 'field_name', ['parent_block_name', 'child_block_name']) . field_name is the name of the StreamField on the Page model. block_name is the name of the StreamBlock within the StreamField to migrate. The mapper function should take page_or_revision and the stream block's value as a dict . This function calls migrate_stream_field() . migrate_stream_field(page_or_revision, field_name, block_path, mapper) \u00b6 Migrate all occurrences of the block name contained within the block_path list belonging to the page or revision using the mapper function. The mapper function should take page_or_revision and the stream block's value as a dict . This function calls migrate_stream_data() . migrate_stream_data(page_or_revision, block_path, stream_data, mapper) \u00b6 Migrate all occurrences of the block name contained within the block_path list within the stream_data dict using the given mapper function. The mapper function should take page_or_revision and the stream block's value as a dict . get_stream_data(page_or_revision, field_name) \u00b6 Get the StreamField data for a given field name on a page or a revision. This function will return a list of dict -like objects containing the blocks within the given StreamField. set_stream_data(page_or_revision, field_name, stream_data, commit=True) \u00b6 Set the StreamField data for a given field name on a page or a revision. If commit is True (default), save() is called on the page_or_revision object. stream_data must be a list of dict -like objects containing the blocks within the given StreamField. Recreating migrations \u00b6 As described above , each time a Django model's definition changes it requires the generation of a new Django migration. Over time, the number of migrations in our apps can grow very large, slowing down testing and the migrate command. For this reason it may be desirable to periodically delete and recreate the migration files, so that instead of a series of files detailing every change over time we have a smaller set that just describes the current state of models in the code. Django does provide an automated squashing process for migrations, but this is often not optimal when migrations contain manual RunPython blocks that we don't necessarily care about keeping around. Instead, we delete all existing migration files and then run manage.py makemigrations to create new ones. This will generate the smallest number of migration files needed to describe the state of models in the code; typically one per app although sometimes multiple are needed due to app dependencies. This process does have these critical side effects: Databases that exist at some migration state before the one at the point of the recreation will no longer be able to be migrated to the current state, as the intermediate changes will have been lost. This means that those databases will need to be recreated. This also means that historical database archives will require a bit more work to resurrect; they'll need to first be migrated to the point just before the recreation, and then updated to code at or after that point. For example, say a database dump exists at a point where N migrations occur. At such time as N + 1 migrations occur, we decide to go through the recreation process. Now we have a new migration numbered N + 2 that represents the equivalent of all (1..N+1) migrations that it replaces. If you try to load and migrate the dump at point N, Django no longer has the code necessary to go from N->N+1 only -- it only has the ability to go from 0->N+2. To recover such a dump, you'll need to check out the code at the point before the recreation was done, migrate from N->N+1, and then check out latest and migrate forwards. Any open pull requests at the time of the recreation that reference or depend on some of the existing migrations will need to be modified to instead refer to the new migration files. Migrations can be recreated with this process: Remove all existing migration files: rm -f -v cfgov/*/migrations/0* Create new migration files from the state of model Python code: cfgov/manage.py makemigrations --noinput As it happens this creates new initial migrations ( 0001_initial ) for all apps, plus some subsequent migrations ( 0002_something ) for apps that depend on other apps (for example, ask_cfpb has its own initial migration and then some changes that rely on v1 ). Rename the created migration files so that they follow in sequence the migration files that used to exist. For example, if at the time of recreation there are 101 v1 migrations, the first new migration should be numbered 102. Manually alter all new migration files to indicate that they replace the old migration files. This involves adding lines to these files like: replaces = [('app_name', '0002_foo'), ('app_name', '0003_bar'), ...] This tells Django that these new files replace the old files, so that when migrations are run again, it doesn't need to do anything. Also manually update any new subsequent migration files so that they properly refer to each other. For example, if an app has two new migrations 102 and 103, the 103 file needs to properly depend on 102.

Even experienced Django developers may find it unintuitive to determine which changes will require a migration. Example model changes that require a migration: Adding, removing, or renaming a model field Changing a model field definition in a way that impacts the database schema (for example, changing the size of a CharField ) Changing a model field definition in a way that does not impact the database schema (for example, changing the field's help_text ) Example model changes that do not require a migration: Adding, removing, renaming, or modifying a model class method Modifying a model class manager The best way to tell if your changes require a migration is to ask Django to determine that for you. Django's makemigrations management command can be used for this purpose: ./cfgov/manage.py makemigrations --dry-run If you haven't made any changes to your local source code that would necessitate the creation of a new migration, this command will print No changes detected . Otherwise, if you have made changes that require a migration, Django will print information about the migration that would need to be created: Migrations for 'v1': cfgov/v1/migrations/0154_auto_20190412_1008.py - Alter field alt on cfgovimage Running with the --dry-run flag won't actually create any migration files on disk.

There is no automatic generation mechanism like there is for schema migrations. You must write the script by hand that automates the transfer of data from old fields to new fields. To generate an empty migration file for your data migration, run: ./cfgov/manage.py makemigrations --empty yourappname You can also copy the code below to get started with forward() and backward() functions to migrate your model's data: from django.db import migrations def forwards(apps, schema_editor): MyModel = apps.get_model('yourappname', 'MyModel') for obj in MyModel.objects.all(): # Make forward changes to the object pass def backwards(apps, schema_editor): MyModel = apps.get_model('yourappname', 'MyModel') for obj in MyModel.objects.all(): # Make backward changes to the object pass class Migration(migrations.Migration): dependencies = [] operations = [ migrations.RunPython(forwards, backwards), ] The forwards() and backwards() functions are where any changes that need to happen to a model's data are made.

This section describes ways we try to address these challenges in consumerfinance.gov. The data migration needs to modify both the existing Wagtail pages that correspond to the changed model and all revisions of that page. It also needs to be able to manipulate the contents of StreamFields. As described in the editing a component guide , it's a three-step process to modify a field without losing data: Create the new field with an automatic schema migration Use a handwritten data migration script to move data from the old field to the new field Delete the old field with an automatic schema migration We've written some utility functions in consumerfinance.gov that make writing data migrations for StreamFields easier. Using these utilities, a Django data migration that modifies a StreamField would use the following format: from django.db import migrations from v1.util.migrations import migrate_page_types_and_fields def forward_mapper(page_or_revision, data): # Manipulate the stream block data forwards return data def backward_mapper(page_or_revision, data): # Manipulate the stream block data backwards return data def forwards(apps, schema_editor): page_types_and_fields = [ ('myapp', 'MyPage', 'field_name', 'block_name'), ] migrate_page_types_and_fields( apps, page_types_and_fields, forward_mapper ) def backwards(apps, schema_editor): page_types_and_fields = [ ('myapp', 'MyPage', 'field_name', 'block_name'), ] migrate_page_types_and_fields( apps, page_types_and_fields, backward_mapper ) class Migration(migrations.Migration): dependencies = [] operations = [ migrations.RunPython(forwards, backwards), ] field_name is the name of the StreamField on the Page model that contains the blocks to migrate. block_name is the name of the block within a StreamField that contains the data to be migrated. StreamBlocks can themselves also contain child blocks. The block name can be given as a list of block names that form the \"path\" to the block that needs to be migrated. For example : def forwards(apps, schema_editor): page_types_and_fields = [ ('myapp', 'MyPage', 'field_name', ['parent_block', 'child_block']), ] migrate_page_types_and_fields( apps, page_types_and_fields, forward_mapper ) In this example, a block with the name child_block that is inside a block named parent_block will be passed to the forward_mapper function.

Over time, the number of migrations in our apps can grow very large, slowing down testing and the migrate command. For this reason it may be desirable to periodically delete and recreate the migration files, so that instead of a series of files detailing every change over time we have a smaller set that just describes the current state of models in the code. Django does provide an automated squashing process for migrations, but this is often not optimal when migrations contain manual RunPython blocks that we don't necessarily care about keeping around. Instead, we delete all existing migration files and then run manage.py makemigrations to create new ones. This will generate the smallest number of migration files needed to describe the state of models in the code; typically one per app although sometimes multiple are needed due to app dependencies. This process does have these critical side effects: Databases that exist at some migration state before the one at the point of the recreation will no longer be able to be migrated to the current state, as the intermediate changes will have been lost. This means that those databases will need to be recreated. This also means that historical database archives will require a bit more work to resurrect; they'll need to first be migrated to the point just before the recreation, and then updated to code at or after that point. For example, say a database dump exists at a point where N migrations occur. At such time as N + 1 migrations occur, we decide to go through the recreation process. Now we have a new migration numbered N + 2 that represents the equivalent of all (1..N+1) migrations that it replaces. If you try to load and migrate the dump at point N, Django no longer has the code necessary to go from N->N+1 only -- it only has the ability to go from 0->N+2. To recover such a dump, you'll need to check out the code at the point before the recreation was done, migrate from N->N+1, and then check out latest and migrate forwards. Any open pull requests at the time of the recreation that reference or depend on some of the existing migrations will need to be modified to instead refer to the new migration files. Migrations can be recreated with this process: Remove all existing migration files: rm -f -v cfgov/*/migrations/0* Create new migration files from the state of model Python code: cfgov/manage.py makemigrations --noinput As it happens this creates new initial migrations ( 0001_initial ) for all apps, plus some subsequent migrations ( 0002_something ) for apps that depend on other apps (for example, ask_cfpb has its own initial migration and then some changes that rely on v1 ). Rename the created migration files so that they follow in sequence the migration files that used to exist. For example, if at the time of recreation there are 101 v1 migrations, the first new migration should be numbered 102. Manually alter all new migration files to indicate that they replace the old migration files. This involves adding lines to these files like: replaces = [('app_name', '0002_foo'), ('app_name', '0003_bar'), ...] This tells Django that these new files replace the old files, so that when migrations are run again, it doesn't need to do anything. Also manually update any new subsequent migration files so that they properly refer to each other. For example, if an app has two new migrations 102 and 103, the 103 file needs to properly depend on 102. To apply these new migration files to an existing database, you can simply run: cfgov/manage.py migrate --noinput You'll see that there are no changes to apply, as the new files should exactly describe the current model state in the same way that the old migrations did.

For any satellite apps that provide front-end assets that need to be built, you will need to run that step seperately: # Check out the retirement satellite app into develop-apps: cd develop-apps git clone git@github.com:cfpb/retirement.git # Build the front-end: cd retirement ./frontendbuild.sh If the satellite app needs any Python requirements that are not specified in the consumerfinance.gov requirements , they will need to be installed seperately by accessing the Python container shell and using pip : docker-compose exec python bash pip install [PACKAGE NAME]","title":"Using Docker"},{"location":"running-docker/","text":"Running in Docker \u00b6 First, follow the Docker installation instructions to setup your Docker environment and create the project Docker containers. We use docker-compose to run an Elasticsearch container, a PostgreSQL container, and Django in a Python container. There is also a container serving the documentation. All of these containers are configured in our docker-compose.yml file . See the Docker documentation for more about the format and use of this file. The following URLs are mapped to your host from the containers: Access consumerfinance.gov running in the Python container: http://localhost:8000/ Access Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200/ View this documentation: http://localhost:8888/ To build and run the containers for the first time, run: docker network create cfgov docker-compose up Environment variables \u00b6 Environment variables from your .env file are sourced when the Python container starts and when you access the running Python container . Your local shell environment variables, however, are not visible to applications running in Docker. To add new environment variables, simply add them to the .env file, stop docker-compose with Ctrl+C, and start it again with docker-compose up . Commands that must be run from within the Python container \u00b6 Django manage.py commands can only be run after you've opened up a shell in the Python container . From there, commands like cfgov/manage.py migrate should run as expected. The same goes for scripts like ./refresh-data.sh and ./initial-data.sh \u2014 they will work as expected once you\u2019re inside the Python container. Access a container\u2019s shell \u00b6 Python: docker-compose exec python bash Elasticsearch: docker-compose exec elasticsearch bash PostgreSQL: docker-compose exec postgres bash Update Python dependencies \u00b6 If the Python package requirements files have changed, you will need to stop docker-compose (if it is running) and rebuild the Python container using: docker-compose up --build python Work on satellite apps \u00b6 See \u201cUsing Docker\u201d on the Related Projects page . Attach for debugging \u00b6 If you have inserted a PDB breakpoint in your code and need to interact with the running Django process when the breakpoint is reached you can run docker attach : docker attach consumerfinance.gov_python_1 When you're done, you can detach with Ctrl+P Ctrl+Q . Useful Docker commands \u00b6 For docker-compose commands, [SERVICE] is the service name that is defined in docker-compose.yml . For docker commands, [CONTAINER] is the container name displayed with docker ps . docker ps will list all containers. docker logs [CONTAINER] will print the logs of a container. docker top [CONTAINER] will display the running processes in a container. docker-compose build [SERVICE] will build any of our configured containers. Production-like Docker Image \u00b6 This repository includes a \"production-like\" Docker image, created for experimenting with how cf.gov could be built and run as a Docker container in production. This includes: all relevant consumerfinance.gov source code all OS, Python, and JS dependencies for building and running the cf.gov webapp procedures for executing Django collectstatic and yarn -based frontend build process an Apache HTTPD webserver with mod_wsgi , run with configs in consumerfinance.gov How do I use it? \u00b6 Just Docker \u00b6 If you just want to build the image: docker build . --build-arg scl_python_version=rh-python36 -t your-desired-image-name Note: The scl_python_version build arg specifies which Python Software Collection version you'd like to use. We've tested this against rh-python36 . Docker Compose \u00b6 You can also launch the full cf.gov stack locally via docker-compose . This setup is a nice way to test out new Apache config changes. It includes volumes that mount your local checkout cfgov/apache config directories into the container, allowing you to change configs locally without having to rebuild the image each time. Launch the stack. docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build This creates a container running cf.gov on Python, as well as Postgres and Elasticsearch containers, much like the development environment.

We call this \"split testing\". In contrast to traditional A/B testing, where the change being tested is shown to a portion of the audience , in the case of split testing, the change is shown to everyone, but only on a subset of similar pages (e.g., a group of related Ask CFPB answers). We call this a subset of pages a \"cluster\". So you've been asked to set up a split testing experiment \u00b6 Good news! The infrastructure has been put in place for you to do it easily. It's set up so that the code being tested is isolated by a feature flag. If you're not familiar with how our flags are set up, read the concepts overview in the django-flags concepts . The flag condition \u00b6 In order to check whether or not a page is part of a split testing cluster, we registered a new flag condition in cfgov/core/feature_flags.py . @conditions.register('in split testing cluster') def in_split_testing_cluster(cluster_group, page, clusters=CLUSTERS, **kwargs): cluster_group = clusters[cluster_group] lookup_value = getattr(page, 'split_test_id', page.id) return lookup_value in chain(*cluster_group.values()) This condition takes the following arguments: - cluster_group : A string that identifies which group of clusters we want to check - page : An instance of a Wagtail page that we want to look for in the cluster group - clusters : A dictionary containing one or more named cluster_group s \u2013 by default, this points to a dictionary defined in our main cluster definition file (see \"Defining clusters\" below) If the page 's id property is found in the cluster_group , the condition returns True . If the page has a split_test_id property defined, it will check that instead of page.id . (More on that later.) You do not need to modify anything in this file to set up a new experiment. Defining clusters \u00b6 To run a split test we first have to know what pages we're testing. Split testing clusters are typically defined in our main cluster definition file at cfgov/core/split_testing_clusters.py . Create a new dictionary with a meaningful name and add the page IDs for the pages in your cluster(s) to it. For example: ASK_CFPB_H1 = { 18: [ 103, 160, 187, 337, 731, 767, 951, 1157, 1161, 1403, 1405, 1439, 1447, 1567, 1695, ], 34: [ 104, 105, 130, 205, 747, 841, 1423, 1791, ], 38: [ 143, 184, 329, 331, 1165, 1637, 1787, 1789, 1797, 1921, 1923, ], 49: [ 136, 161, 163, 164, 172, 176, 179, 180, 181, 188, 192, 336, 817, 1699, 1983, 1989, 1995, 1997, 2001, ], 93: [ 146, 226, 237, 318, 338, 545, 633, 811, 1215, 1463, 1507, ], } In the above example, there are five separate clusters, all of which will be part of the experiment. The number being used for the keys doesn't matter to Python, but it may be useful for internal tracking purposes. As noted earlier, normally the page IDs inside the lists correspond to Wagtail's page ID (most easily findable in the edit URL for a page), but in this particular example, they are actually Ask CFPB answer IDs . For Ask CFPB answer pages, we use the answer ID, because that ID is frequently used in internal communications for shorthand references to Ask answers. All other page types use their Wagtail page ID value. If you have cause to use something else for the lookup values, you can define the split_test_id property in a page class. For example: # cfgov/ask_cfpb/models/pages.py class AnswerPage(CFGOVPage): \u2026 # Overrides the default of page.id for comparing against split testing # clusters. See: core.feature_flags.in_split_testing_cluster @property def split_test_id(self): return self.answer_base.id \u2026 If you do this, remember to add a simple test: # cfgov/ask_cfpb/tests/models/test_pages.py def test_answer_split_testing_id(self): \"\"\"Confirm AnswerPage's split_testing_id is set to its answer_base.id, which is checked by the core.feature_flags.in_split_testing_cluster flag condition when doing split testing on Ask CFPB answer pages.\"\"\" answer = self.answer1234 page = answer.english_page self.assertEqual(page.split_test_id, answer.id) You will also need to add a reference to your new dictionary to the CLUSTERS dictionary at the bottom of the file: CLUSTERS = { 'ASK_CFPB_H1': ASK_CFPB_H1, } Creating and using the flag \u00b6 The new \"in split testing cluster\" condition described earlier can be added to flags and used like any other feature flag. For the example we started above, we first create the flag in our settings, giving it the default condition with a parameter corresponding to the cluster group name we created above: # cfgov/settings/base.py \u2026 # Feature flags # All feature flags must be listed here with a dict of any hard-coded # conditions or an empty dict.

What follows is a brief introduction to translations with the particular tools consumerfinance.gov uses (like Jinja2 templates) and the conventions we use. Overview \u00b6 Django translations use GNU gettext (see the installation instructions ). By convention, translations are usually performed in code by wrapping a string to be translated in a function that is either named or aliased with an underscore. For example: _(\"This is a translatable string.\") These strings are collected into portable object ( .po ) files for each supported language. These files map the original string ( msgid ) to a matching translated string ( msgstr ). For example: msgid \"This is a translatable string.\" msgstr \"Esta es una cadena traducible.\" These portable object files are compiled into machine object files ( .mo ) that the translation system uses when looking up the original string. By convention the .po and .mo files live inside a locale/[LANGUAGE]/LC_MESSAGES/ folder structure, for example, cfgov/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po for the Spanish language portable object file for all of our consumerfinance.gov messages. How to translate text in consumerfinance.gov \u00b6 This brief howto will guide you through adding translatable text to consumerfinance.gov. 1. Add the translation function around the string \u00b6 In Jinja2 templates: {{ _(\"Hello World!\") }} In Django templates: {% load i18n %} {% trans \"Hello World!\" %} In Python code: from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _ mystring = _(\"Hello World!\") The string in the call to the translation function will be the msgid in the portable object file below. 2. Run the makemessages management command to add the string to the portable object file \u00b6 The makemessages management command will look through all Python, Django, and Jinja2 template files to find strings that are wrapped in a translation function call and add them to the portable object file for a particular language. The language is specified with -l . The command also must be called from the root of the Django app tree, not the project root. To generate or update the portable object file for Spanish: cd cfgov django-admin.py makemessages -l es 3. Edit the portable object file to add a translation for the string \u00b6 The portable object files are stored in cfgov/locale/[LANGUAGE]/LC_MESSAGES/ . For the Spanish portable object file, edit cfgov/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po and add the Spanish translation as the msgstr for your new msgid msgid \"Hello World!\" msgstr \"Hola Mundo!\" 4. Run the compilemessages management command to compile the machine object file \u00b6 cd cfgov django-admin.py compilemessages Wagtail Considerations \u00b6 All of our Wagtail pages include a language-selection dropdown under its Configuration tab: The selected language will force translation of all translatable strings in templates and code for that page. Troubleshooting \u00b6 To ensure that strings in templates are picked up in message extraction ( django-admin.py makemessages ), it also helps to know that the way makemessages works. makemessages converts all Django {% translate %} , {% blocktranslate %} , and Jinja2 {% trans %} tags into _(\u2026) gettext calls and then to have xgettext process the files as if they were Python. This process does not work the same as general template parsing, and it means that it's best to make the translatable strings as discoverable as possible. There are a few things to avoid to make sure the strings are picked up by makemessages : Do not include the _() call in a larger Jinja2 template data structure: \u00b6 + {% set link_text = _(\"Visit our website\") %} {% set link_data = { \"url\": \"https://consumerfinance.gov\", - \"text\": _(\"Visit our website\"), + \"text\": link_text, } %} Do not include spaces between the parentheses and the string in Jinja2 templates: \u00b6 - {{ _( \"Hello World!\" ) }} + {{ _(\"Hello World!\") }} Do not use f-strings in Python calls to gettext: \u00b6 - _(f\"Hello {world_name}\") + _(\"Hello %(world_name)s\" % {'world_name': world_name}) Django's documentation has some additional information on the limitations of translatable strings and gettext . Do mark variable strings for translation with gettext_noop \u00b6 If you have a variable that will be translated in a template later using the variable name, but you need to mark it for translation so that makemessages will pick it up, use Django's gettext_noop : from django.utils.translation import gettext_noop mystring = _(\"Hello World!\") {{ _(mystring) }}","title":"Translation"},{"location":"translation/#translation","text":"As consumerfinance.gov is a Django project, the Django translation documentation is a good place to start .

All CFPB Wagtail pages should inherit from the v1.models.base.CFGOVPage class . Note Before creating a new Wagtail page type please consider whether one of our existing page types can meet your needs. Talk to the consumerfinance.gov product owners if your content is significantly different from anything else on the site or a specific maintenance efficiency will be gained from a new page type. There are types of information defined on a new Wagtail page model: basic database fields (like any Django model), specialized database fields called StreamFields that allow for freeform page content, and editor panels that present these fields to content editors. Fields \u00b6 Database fields in Wagtail pages work exactly the same as in Django models , and Wagtail pages can use any Django model field . For example, our BrowsePage includes a standard Django BooleanField that allows content editors to toggle secondary navigation sibling pages: from django.db import models from v1.models.base import CFGOVPage class BrowsePage(CFGOVPage): secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages = models.BooleanField(default=False) StreamFields \u00b6 StreamFields are special Django model fields provided by Wagtail for freeform page content . They allow a content editor to pick any number number of optional components and place them in any order within their StreamField. In practice, this provides the flexibility of a large rich text field, with the structure of individual components . For example, our LandingPage page model includes a header StreamField that can have a hero and/or a text introduction: from wagtail.core.fields import StreamField from v1.atomic_elements import molecules from v1.models import CFGOVPage class LandingPage(CFGOVPage): header = StreamField([ ('hero', molecules.Hero()), ('text_introduction', molecules.TextIntroduction()), ], blank=True) The specifics of StreamField block components can be found in Creating and Editing Wagtail Components . Panels \u00b6 Editor panels define how the page's fields and StreamFields will be organized for content editors; they correspond to the tabs that appear across the top of the edit view for a page in the Wagtail admin. The base Wagtail Page class and the CFGOVPage subclass of it define specific sets of panels to which all fields should be added: content_panels : For page body content. These fields appear on the \"General Content\" tab when editing a page. sidefoot_panels : For page sidebar or footer content. These fields appear on the \"Sidebar\" tab when editing a page. settings_panels : Page configuration such as the categories, tags, scheduled publishing, etc. Appears on the \"Configuration\" tab when editing a page. Most fields will simply require a FieldPanel to be added to one of the sets of panels above. StreamFields will require a StreamFieldPanel . See the Wagtail documentation for additional, more complex panel options . For example, in our BrowsePage (used in the database fields example above ), the secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages BooleanField is added to the sidefoot_panels as a FieldPanel : from django.db import models from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel from v1.models.base import CFGOVPage class BrowsePage(CFGOVPage): secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages = models.BooleanField(default=False) # \u2026 sidefoot_panels = CFGOVPage.sidefoot_panels + [ FieldPanel('secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages'), ] Because secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages is a boolean field, this creates a checkbox on the \"Sidebar/Footer\" tab when editing a page. Checking or unchecking that checkbox will set the value of secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages when the page is saved. In our LandingPage (used in the StreamFields example above ), the header StreamField is added to the content_panels as a StreamFieldPanel : from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import StreamFieldPanel from wagtail.core.fields import StreamField from v1.atomic_elements import molecules from v1.models import CFGOVPage class LandingPage(CFGOVPage): header = StreamField([ ('hero', molecules.Hero()), ('text_introduction', molecules.TextIntroduction()), ], blank=True) # \u2026 content_panels = CFGOVPage.content_panels + [ StreamFieldPanel('header'), # \u2026 ] Parent / child page relationships \u00b6 Wagtail provides two attributes to page models that enable restricting the types of subpages or parent pages a particular page model can have. On any page model: parent_page_types limits which page types this type can be created under. subpage_types limits which page types can be created under this type. For example, in our interactive regulations page models we have a RegulationLandingPage that can be created anywhere in the page tree. RegulationLandingPage , however, can only have two types of pages created within it: RegulationPage and RegulationSearchPage . This parent/child relationship is expressed by setting subpage_types on RegulationLandingPage and parent_page_types on RegulationPage and RegulationSearchPage to a model name in the form 'app_label.ModelName': from v1.models import CFGOVPage class RegulationLandingPage(CFGOVPage): subpage_types = ['regulations3k.RegulationPage', 'regulations3k.RegulationsSearchPage'] class RegulationsSearchPage(CFGOVPage): parent_page_types = ['regulations3k.RegulationLandingPage'] subpage_types = [] class RegulationPage(CFGOVPage): parent_page_types = ['regulations3k.RegulationLandingPage'] subpage_types = [] Note We prevent child pages from being added to RegulationPage and RegulationSearchPage by setting subpage_types to an empty list. Template rendering \u00b6 New Wagtail page types will usually need to make customizations to their base template when rendering the page . This is done by overriding the template attribute on the page model. For example, the interactive regulations landing page includes a customized list of recently issued notices that gets loaded dynamically from the Federal Register. To do this it provides its own template that inherits from our base templates and overrides the content_sidebar block to include a separate recent_notices template: from v1.models import CFGOVPage class RegulationLandingPage(CFGOVPage): template = 'regulations3k/landing-page.html' And in regulations3k/landing-page.html : {% extends 'layout-2-1-bleedbar.html' %} {% import 'recent-notices.html' as recent_notices with context %} {% block content_sidebar scoped -%} {{ recent_notices }} {%- endblock %}","title":"Wagtail Pages"},{"location":"wagtail-pages/#wagtail-pages","text":"Wagtail pages are Django models that are constructed of fields , StreamFields , and panels that are rendered in a standard way. All CFPB Wagtail pages should inherit from the v1.models.base.CFGOVPage class . Note Before creating a new Wagtail page type please consider whether one of our existing page types can meet your needs. Talk to the consumerfinance.gov product owners if your content is significantly different from anything else on the site or a specific maintenance efficiency will be gained from a new page type. There are types of information defined on a new Wagtail page model: basic database fields (like any Django model), specialized database fields called StreamFields that allow for freeform page content, and editor panels that present these fields to content editors.","title":"Wagtail pages"},{"location":"wagtail-pages/#fields","text":"Database fields in Wagtail pages work exactly the same as in Django models , and Wagtail pages can use any Django model field . For example, our BrowsePage includes a standard Django BooleanField that allows content editors to toggle secondary navigation sibling pages: from django.db import models from v1.models.base import CFGOVPage class BrowsePage(CFGOVPage): secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages = models.BooleanField(default=False)","title":"Fields"},{"location":"wagtail-pages/#streamfields","text":"StreamFields are special Django model fields provided by Wagtail for freeform page content . They allow a content editor to pick any number number of optional components and place them in any order within their StreamField. In practice, this provides the flexibility of a large rich text field, with the structure of individual components . For example, our LandingPage page model includes a header StreamField that can have a hero and/or a text introduction: from wagtail.core.fields import StreamField from v1.atomic_elements import molecules from v1.models import CFGOVPage class LandingPage(CFGOVPage): header = StreamField([ ('hero', molecules.Hero()), ('text_introduction', molecules.TextIntroduction()), ], blank=True) The specifics of StreamField block components can be found in Creating and Editing Wagtail Components .","title":"StreamFields"},{"location":"wagtail-pages/#panels","text":"Editor panels define how the page's fields and StreamFields will be organized for content editors; they correspond to the tabs that appear across the top of the edit view for a page in the Wagtail admin. The base Wagtail Page class and the CFGOVPage subclass of it define specific sets of panels to which all fields should be added: content_panels : For page body content. These fields appear on the \"General Content\" tab when editing a page. sidefoot_panels : For page sidebar or footer content. These fields appear on the \"Sidebar\" tab when editing a page. settings_panels : Page configuration such as the categories, tags, scheduled publishing, etc. Appears on the \"Configuration\" tab when editing a page. Most fields will simply require a FieldPanel to be added to one of the sets of panels above. StreamFields will require a StreamFieldPanel . See the Wagtail documentation for additional, more complex panel options . For example, in our BrowsePage (used in the database fields example above ), the secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages BooleanField is added to the sidefoot_panels as a FieldPanel : from django.db import models from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel from v1.models.base import CFGOVPage class BrowsePage(CFGOVPage): secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages = models.BooleanField(default=False) # \u2026 sidefoot_panels = CFGOVPage.sidefoot_panels + [ FieldPanel('secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages'), ] Because secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages is a boolean field, this creates a checkbox on the \"Sidebar/Footer\" tab when editing a page. Checking or unchecking that checkbox will set the value of secondary_nav_exclude_sibling_pages when the page is saved. In our LandingPage (used in the StreamFields example above ), the header StreamField is added to the content_panels as a StreamFieldPanel : from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import StreamFieldPanel from wagtail.core.fields import StreamField from v1.atomic_elements import molecules from v1.models import CFGOVPage class LandingPage(CFGOVPage): header = StreamField([ ('hero', molecules.Hero()), ('text_introduction', molecules.TextIntroduction()), ], blank=True) # \u2026 content_panels = CFGOVPage.content_panels + [ StreamFieldPanel('header'), # \u2026 ]","title":"Panels"},{"location":"wagtail-pages/#parent-child-page-relationships","text":"Wagtail provides two attributes to page models that enable restricting the types of subpages or parent pages a particular page model can have. On any page model: parent_page_types limits which page types this type can be created under. subpage_types limits which page types can be created under this type. For example, in our interactive regulations page models we have a RegulationLandingPage that can be created anywhere in the page tree. RegulationLandingPage , however, can only have two types of pages created within it: RegulationPage and RegulationSearchPage . This parent/child relationship is expressed by setting subpage_types on RegulationLandingPage and parent_page_types on RegulationPage and RegulationSearchPage to a model name in the form 'app_label.ModelName': from v1.models import CFGOVPage class RegulationLandingPage(CFGOVPage): subpage_types = ['regulations3k.RegulationPage', 'regulations3k.RegulationsSearchPage'] class RegulationsSearchPage(CFGOVPage): parent_page_types = ['regulations3k.RegulationLandingPage'] subpage_types = [] class RegulationPage(CFGOVPage): parent_page_types = ['regulations3k.RegulationLandingPage'] subpage_types = [] Note We prevent child pages from being added to RegulationPage and RegulationSearchPage by setting subpage_types to an empty list.","title":"Parent / child page relationships"},{"location":"wagtail-pages/#template-rendering","text":"New Wagtail page types will usually need to make customizations to their base template when rendering the page .
